2025 Fantasy Football: Best and Worst Picks from Each Round,"2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks from Each Round 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks from Each Round (Aug. 3): These are the best and worst picks from each round in fantasy football 2025. This will cover the first 12 rounds of fantasy football drafts, and will be constantly updated throughout the summer. If you’re looking for players who come with great value in the later rounds, check out our 2025 Fantasy Football Sleepers list. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 1 Best: Malik Nabers, WR, Giants Worst: Christian McCaffrey, RB, 49ers I love Malik Nabers. I think there’s a good chance he’s the WR1 at this time next year. He sees tons of targets and has no competition for them. Even though Russell Wilson isn’t very good, he’ll be a big upgrade over what Nabers had to work with at the end of the 2024 season, which was Drew Lock and Tommy DeVito. Nabers had the fourth-most unrealized air yards as a rookie, so that’ll improve with upgraded quarterback play. Nabers’ toe injury scares me, but he’s had that problem since college, and has been dominant at every opportunity. Christian McCaffrey has great upside based on what he’s accomplished in the past, but he’s now an older running back with an extensive injury history. I always say that you can’t win your fantasy drafts in the first couple of rounds because half the league will draft a stud, but you can lose you fantasy draft by selecting a bust. No one in the first round has greater bust potential than McCaffrey, who hasn’t been able to finish three of his previous five seasons. McCaffrey, who has chronic Achillies tendonitis, has missed 43 percent of his games since 2020. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 2 Best: A.J. Brown, WR, Eagles Worst: Tyreek Hill, WR, Dolphins A.J. Brown was a first-round pick last year. Despite nothing changing, Brown is now being chosen in the middle of the second round. Brown has great upside and will continue to be the No. 1 receiver in an explosive offense, so he’s a bargain at ADP 2.06. Tyreek Hill is now in his 30s, and he looked like he lost a step last year. Miami also doesn’t have the offensive line to support his downfield targets. Tua Tagovailoa’s poor health is an issue as well. Oh, and if that wasn’t enough, Hill could be thrown in jail at some point soon. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 3 Best: Omarion Hampton, RB, Chargers Worst: Mike Evans, WR, Buccaneers Omarion Hampton’s ADP has risen a whole round recently, but for good reason. Najee Harris’ vision has been compromised by a fireworks accident, so it seems as though Hampton will control the entire backfield. Playing in a great offense, Hampton will have tons of great opportunities. Here’s another old receiver who relies on speed. Mike Evans is 32 and has a history of hamstring issues. There’s a good chance Emeka Ebguka takes over as the No. 1 receiver in Tampa Bay this year. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 4 Best: Jayden Daniels, WR, Redskins Worst: Xavier Worthy, WR, Chiefs Round 4 is a complete dead zone. I don’t like any running backs or receivers chosen in this round, so I usually find myself targeting a quarterback or George Kittle unless I’m lucky enough to land a third-round player in this range. If I had to pick a quarterback or Kittle that I want more than anyone else, it’s Jayden Daniels, who will likely expand upon his rookie campaign with Laremy Tunsil and Deebo Samuel enhancing his supporting cast. Xavier Worthy is the No. 2 receiver on an offense that hasn’t been very explosive in years. Worthy would be a fine option if Rashee Rice were sidelined for most of the year again, but his return complicates matters, even with the looming suspension. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 5 Best: Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans Worst: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Panthers I think people forgot how great Calvin Ridley can be because of last year’s results where he was playing with Will Levis and Mason Rudolph. Ridley led the NFL in unrealized air yards in 2024, which basically means that he would’ve enjoyed a massive season with improved quarterbacking. Cam Ward is unproven, but will almost certainly be a massive upgrade over Levis and Rudolph. Ridley’s situation reminds me of Terry McLaurin’s heading into 2024, so Ridley could enjoy the type of season McLaurin just had. Tetairoa McMillan was a top-10 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, but he wouldn’t have been chosen in the top 10 in a normal year. Heck, he wouldn’t have even been a top-10 pick this year had meddlesome owner Axe Tepper not gotten involved with the decision-making once again. McMillan admittedly doesn’t love football, so will he put forth the work effort to be a great pro? It seems like he has “bust” written all over him. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 6 Best: Rome Odunze, WR, Bears Worst: Stefon Diggs, WR, Patriots I love both Bears players in this round- Rome Odunze, D’Andre Swift – but I’ll go with the higher upside. Some of Charlie Campbell’s team sources thought so highly of Odunze that they graded him very closely with Marvin Harrison Jr. and Malik Nabers. Second-year receivers typically get the greatest bump, and I think we’re going to see that with Odunze, thanks to Caleb Williams’ experience, Keenan Allen’s departure, Ben Johnson’s hiring, and the offensive line’s improvement. There’s a good chance Odunze overtakes D.J. Moore as the No. 1 receiver on Chicago’s roster. Stefon Diggs in the sixth round seems rather horrible. Diggs is a 31-year-old receiver coming off a torn ACL, and he’ll be playing in a run-first offense for the first time in his career. I wouldn’t even draft him in the ninth round. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 7 Best: Emeka Egbuka, WR, Buccaneers Worst: Travis Kelce, TE, Chiefs Emeka Egbuka could be a potential league winner. He’s an incredibly talented rookie receiver who appears to be in a crowded situation. This is deceiving, however. Chris Godwin is already iffy to play in Week 1, so he may not be able to be on the field very much this season. Egbuka will be ahead of Jalen McMillan as well. And Mike Evans is 32, so he could break down at any moment. Travis Kelce is useless at this stage of his career. He tends to save himself for the playoffs, and yet he barely did anything in the playoffs last year. Kelce and Rashee Rice operate in the same area on the field, so Kelce could be even less productive than he was in 2024. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 8 Best: Josh Downs, WR, Colts Worst: Chris Godwin, WR, Buccaneers Round 8 isn’t great now that Emeka Egbuka and Ricky Pearsall have moved into Round 7. Josh Downs isn’t bad though. He had a high ankle sprain entering 2024, and yet he had a strong season despite the injury and the bad quarterbacking. The Colts will have a better passing attack this year. Chris Godwin is a truly awful pick in the eighth round. There’s already pessimism about him being available for Week 1, and yet it’s only early July. This reminds me so much of the Christian McCaffrey situation last year. It wouldn’t be shocking at all to see Godwin play only a handful of games this year. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 9 Best: Tyler Warren, WR, Colts Worst: Travis Etienne, RB, Jaguars Could Tyler Warren repeat what Brock Bowers did last year? Warren is ultra athletic and will be a dominant force over the middle of the field for the Colts. Warren will also steal some touchdowns via the tush push. Travis Etienne has had his chance to prove himself in the NFL. He has failed at every opportunity. He was even benched in favor of Tank Bigsby last year. So, why is he going in the ninth round when Jacksonville added another running back? 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 10 Best: Zach Charbonnet, RB, Seahawks Worst: Cam Skattebo, RB, Giants There’s a good chance Kenneth Walker is dealt at the trade deadline. Walker is in his contract year, and the Seahawks are not going to be a good team. If I’m right, Zach Charbonnet could be a monster during the second half of the season. I referenced Cam Skattebo a bit earlier. Everyone remembers Skattebo’s great game versus Texas in the college football playoff, which is causing him to be severely overdrafted. Skattebo should be a 14th-round pick, as he’s currently third in the pecking order of a three-man committee. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 11 Best: Tucker Kraft, TE, Packers Worst: Marvin Mims, WR, Broncos Tucker Kraft is the best tight end value in fantasy this year. He should be going in the ninth or perhaps even the eighth round instead of the 11th. He had some big performances last year, and Matthew Golden’s presence will open things up for him over the middle of the field. Marvin Mims is being overdrafted because he had two great games to close out 2024. However, Sean Payton is infatuated with size from his receivers, which is why he used a third-round pick on Pat Bryant. It’s likely that Mims will be relegated to special teams this year with Bryant or Troy Franklin being an upgrade across from Courtland Sutton. 2025 Fantasy Football Best and Worst Picks: Round 12 Best: Isaac Guerendo, RB, 49ers Worst: Luther Burden, WR, Bears Isaac Guerendo is another potential league winner. Christian McCaffrey has failed to finish three of his previous five seasons. Guerendo could post massive numbers if McCaffrey gets hurt again. It’s puzzling that Luther Burden is going so early. The Bears have such a crowded receiver group, and Burden has been injured. Ben Johnson has even expressed frustration with Burden’s poor health. | Injured/injury risk | Potential bust | Potential sleeper | ||| | Rank higher in touchdown leagues | Rank lower in touchdown leagues | |||| | Rank higher in PPR (points per reception) leagues | Rank lower in PPR leagues |",2025-08-08,https://walterfootball.com/fantasy2025bestworst.php

"2025 Fantasy football positional rankings: Proven model reveals top NFL QB, WR, RB, TE, kicker, defense picks","2025 Fantasy football positional rankings: Proven model reveals top NFL QB, WR, RB, TE, kicker, defense picks SportsLine simulated the new NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football QB, RB, WR, TE, kicker and defense rankings Christian McCaffrey has routinely been atop the Fantasy football running back rankings throughout his career, and it has paid off for his owners multiple times. He was the RB1 in 2019, RB2 in 2022 and RB1 in 2023, leading teams to Fantasy football championships. However, he is also a massive injury risk, as he has missed double-digit games in three of the last five seasons. McCaffrey is available later in 2025 Fantasy football drafts than he has been in recent years, so an injury is likely the only factor that will determine whether he lands among the Fantasy football sleepers or Fantasy football busts. Injuries can often come down solely to luck, but a player with an injury history should be accounted for in your 2025 Fantasy football strategy. A full set of Fantasy football rankings can assist you when you are building 2025 Fantasy football lineups. Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football positional rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert's disappointing follow-up to a breakout 2023 season. It also called C.J. Stroud's down year, predicted Jayden Daniels' breakout campaign and projected James Cook to become one of Fantasy football's elite running backs in 2024. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018 and Davante Adams in 2017. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football positional rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts at every position. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football QB rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top 2025 Fantasy football QB picks: 1. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens: Jackson was the No. 1 QB in Fantasy last year, completing 316 of 474 passes for a career-high 4,172 yards and 41 touchdowns across 17 regular-season games. Jackson tossed only four interceptions as well and added 915 rushing yards and four scores on the ground. His dual-threat ability makes him the clear-cut No. 1 option again for 2025. 2. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills: Allen is coming off a remarkable season in Buffalo. Allen completed 64% of his passes for 3,731 yards and 28 touchdowns while also adding 531 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground over 17 regular-season games in 2024. He remains a top option at quarterback with the potential to be QB1. 3. Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals: Burrow led the NFL in passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) last season while completing 71% of his passes. Burrow has a plethora of weapons on the offensive side of the ball, including Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, Chase Brown and Mike Gesicki, a big reason why the model is expecting another productive campaign for Cincinnati's signal caller. See more top QBs here. Top 2025 Fantasy football RB rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top 2025 Fantasy football RB picks: 1. Jahmyr Gibbs, Detroit Lions: Gibbs finished with 1,412 rushing yards last season, which ranked fifth in the NFL. He averaged 5.6 yards per carry and racked up 16 rushing touchdowns. Gibbs also proved to be a threat in the passing game, hauling in 52 receptions for 517 yards and four scores a season ago. 2. Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons: Robinson averaged 22.5 PPR points per game in his final eight outings last season. Robinson, who averaged 20.1 PPR points per game for the season, averaged 17.2 total touches per game in his first six outings last year. But over his final 11 games, Robinson averaged 23.9 total touches per game, which could be the norm in 2025 with Michael Penix Jr. under center. 3. Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles: Barkley was dominant for the Eagles in 2025, leading Philadelphia to a Super Bowl title. He led the NFL in total touches (378), total yards (2,283), rushing attempts (345), and rushing yards (2,005). Barkley also finished third in total snaps and ended the season as RB1 overall in all scoring formats despite finishing just 37th in targets per game and sixth in total touchdowns (15). See more top RBs here. Top 2025 Fantasy football WR rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top 2025 Fantasy football WR picks: 1. Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals: Chase became the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history this offseason, signing a historic four-year extension. He finished as the WR1 in Fantasy points per game last season, ranking first in targets (175), red zone targets (36), total touchdowns (17) and receiving yards (1,708), among others. He is the clear-cut top wide receiver in the model's rankings. 2. Malik Nabers, New York Giants: The LSU product is coming off a monster rookie season, finishing as the WR7 in Fantasy points per game. Nabers ranked first in target share and seventh in receiving yards per game, drawing 170 targets overall. He was able to overcome bad quarterback play, so he should be in line for an even better campaign in 2025. 3. CeeDee Lamb, Dallas Cowboys: Lamb is coming off a down year by his standards, but he still posted a WR8 finish despite playing through a shoulder injury and losing quarterback Dak Prescott. He caught at least four passes in all but one game, and he is still the obvious top target in Dallas. Prescott is back, so Lamb has returned to the top of the Fantasy WR rankings. See more top WRs here. Top 2025 Fantasy football TE rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top 2025 Fantasy football TE picks: 1. Brock Bowers, Las Vegas Raiders: For the second straight year, a rookie tight end finished as TE1, as the No. 13 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft had a record-breaking rookie season. Bowers broke Puka Nacua's rookie record for receptions (112). He also led all tight ends with 1,194 yards. The Raiders didn't make any significant additions at wide receiver or tight end, but they did acquire Geno Smith at quarterback, which should be an upgrade, as Bowers has a strong chance to repeat at TE1 again this year. 2. George Kittle, San Francisco 49ers: Kittle had the second-most yards (1,106) and touchdowns (eight) of his eight-year NFL career last season as the veteran tight end remains one of the most consistent pass-catchers in the league. He's coming off his second straight 1,000-yard season and has more than 900 yards in five of his last seven years. The 49ers traded Deebo Samuel, which could signal even more targets Kittle's way from Brock Purdy in one of the top offenses in the NFL. 3. Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals: McBride had the second-most receiving yards (1,146) among tight ends last year and finished as the TE2 despite only two receiving touchdowns. The 25-year-old tight end was fourth in the NFL with 111 receptions, so only having two touchdowns with that heavy of a usage is an anomaly. McBride will still generate a massive target share in Arizona, which is running back a similar offensive playmaking group from last season, and he's almost guaranteed to have a better touchdown total given his importance to the offense. See more top TEs here. Top 2025 Fantasy football defense rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top three 2025 Fantasy football D/ST picks: 1. Philadelphia Eagles D/ST: Howie Roseman is one of the NFL's best executives but his turnaround of the Philadelphia pass defense from 2023 to 2024 was masterful. They went from ranking 30th in points allowed and 26th in yards allowed to ranking second in scoring defense and first in total defense in just one offseason. Now most of the key pieces from that unit return. 2. Baltimore Ravens D/ST: Baltimore had the best run defense in football last season and should have an improved secondary after drafting Malaki Starks in the first round and signing Jaire Alexander. They've got high-level playmakers at every level in Kyle Van Noy, Roquan Smith and Kyle Hamilton. 3. Minnesota Vikings D/ST: They were the No. 5 scoring defense in the NFL last season and they led the NFL with 33 takeaways. Minnesota also scored three defensive touchdowns, and even if the takeaway numbers can't be relied on, the boom potential here is too high to ignore. See more top D/ST here. Top 2025 Fantasy football kicker rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top 2025 Fantasy football K picks: 1. Brandon Aubrey, Dallas Cowboys: Aubrey has the biggest leg in the league and he tied for second in the NFL in points (150) last season. He's 76-of-85 on field goals the last two seasons and he's a staggering 24-of-27 from 50 yards or more. 2. Matt Gay, Washington Commanders: Jayden Daniels is the rising tide that lifts all boats and this offense looks primed to be even better in 2025 after the offseason additions of Laremy Tunsil and Deebo Samuel. Gay was perfect from inside of 50 yards last season and closed the year strong, with 24 points in the final two games of the regular season. 3. Tyler Bass, Buffalo Bills: Despite only making 82.8% of his field goal attempts, Bass finished tied for ninth in scoring (131 points). He was perfect on field goals of more than 50 yards and also locked in during the 2025 NFL playoffs, going 6-for-6 overall.

The Best Picks In 2025 Fantasy Football Drafts | Underdog Network,"A lot of our offseason fantasy football research has been identifying trends for finding the actual league winning picks. Depending on the definition, there are about 10-20 players who really swing things each season, and they represent the playoff teams at a disproportional rate. In other words, find 1-2 huge hits, and you can win even if the rest of your team is average. This is what we went over with Ryan Heath (watch below), Jakob Sanderson, and Ron Stewart recently, and I have even more data to point us in the correct direction. This chart shows the upside hit rates by position throughout Best Ball Mania drafts. A ""hit"" is defined as a player who is in the top 5th percentile, in terms of his team's average points scored in the Underdog Fantasy regular season for that particular year. As a reference point, these were the 15 players who qualified last year in order of importance: WR Ja'Marr Chase (his teams averaged 1,665 regular season points), RB Saquon Barkley, QB Joe Burrow, RB Derrick Henry, RB Chuba Hubbard, WR Jauan Jennings, RB Alvin Kamara, RB Josh Jacobs, QB Lamar Jackson, WR Jerry Jeudy, WR Courtland Sutton, QB Sam Darnold, WR Terry McLaurin, and RB Chase Brown. That's a good metric! So what are the takeaways from the chart? WRs in Rounds 3-4 have a 2.8% upside hit rate, and this is the part of the draft where WR prices have gone up the most in recent seasons. There has been research on RPOs going to true alphas, not this next tier of real-life WRs. The fantasy community may also be forcing WRs up this high for perceived roster construction advantages, which is very much up for debate now that the RB dead zone window no longer exists in this range. TEs are rarely on these top 5th percentile players. It's happened just twice; 2023 Travis Kelce and 2021 Travis Kelce, although 2021 Rob Gronkowski and 2021 Mark Andrews just missed the threshold. Here are there respective yards per game and total TDs as a baseline of what is necessary to pull this off: 79YPG & 12TD, 94 & 11, 62 & 6 (this was driven by MVP Tom Brady correlation), and 80 & 9. 8 out of 10 upside hit QBs were top-120 picks. After looking at these hits, it's the dual-threat QBs in the Round 3-4 range or the pocket passers in the 73-120 range only. This makes sense. The dual-threats can provide such an advantage in half PPR by themselves, while a passer who gets their with passing TDs drags up multiple pass catchers, giving the entire roster more upside. There are more last-round WR upside hits than given credit for. Let's look at picks after 180th overall and change the upside hit definition to just top 16% teams (like you'll see below). There were 18 WR hits, 12 TE hits, 10 RB hits, and 5 QB hits. Today's goal is to find the next group of players who will be on these top 5th percentile teams, and a great place to start is by looking in the first top-120 picks. Sure, there will be players we will tack onto winning teams, but most of the upside on a team happens early. Just check out this chart where I looked at the top 16% teams, which matches up with the regular season advancing of 2/12 teams. It's this range that's the focus. I have 5 rookies, 2 ""washed"" RBs, and about 20 players who are at least good at football. 1. RB Jahmyr Gibbs (ADP: 5th): Only Saquon and Derrick Henry averaged more half PPR points per game last year (18.3), and there are multiple ways he can take another leap. David Montgomery could no longer be the ""starter"" and handle a 50/50 split of goal-line touches, or D-Mont could just miss significant time. In either scenario, Gibbs has 1st overall player in fantasy easily within his range of outcomes. There are reasons to believe an OL step back is likely--replacing All Pro C Frank Ragnow isn't easy--but 2nd-round IOL Tate Ratledge is a great athlete, Graham Glasnow is a veteran, and the flashes down the stretch from LG Christian Mahogany were sweet. With Jared Goff playing his best ball ever, this team is more equipped to overcome OC and C departures than ever. And if shit hits the fan, give the ball to Gibbs and see what happens. 2. RB Christian McCaffrey (ADP: 7th): Since his 2018 breakout, CMC is the owner of the 1st, 3rd, 12th, and 18th spots in single-season half PPR points among all RBs, WRs, and TEs. His bankability of elite fantasy production is unrivaled when he's on the field, and the 29-year-old was out there practicing all offseason coming off a season when he only handled 65 touches. We have 10 seasons of a RB averaging more than 18.3 half PPR points at his age or older since 2000, so it's certainly possible he bounces all the way back towards fantasy greatness. If you only play in one league and don't want the risk, I get it. If you're firing up more than a couple or aren't scared to compete, let's get aggressive for as long as he survives training camp healthy. 90% of teams are going to lose anyways. It helps that the 49ers are projected for the 3rd-most points this year on the easiest strength of schedule. 3. WR Nico Collins (ADP: 10th): Here are the WRs with more yards per route over the past two seasons: ... It's just him in the 3.0+ club right now, and Collins enters his prime just as his QB does. The competition for targets is relatively weak, and there's nothing but room for improvement in terms of play calling with new OC Nick Caley and a new OL coach. Collins has speed, size, and manufactured touch ability all in one. For much of 2024, he had the highest in-game miles per hour. At 6'4""!!! There is a little more injury risk with the WRs around him (Nabers' toe, Amon-Ra's knee surgery, Puka with Stafford's back, etc.), so ties are breaking towards him at the Round 1/2 turn. 4. WR Brian Thomas (ADP: 13th): The only WR to average more half PPR points from Week 12 on last year was Ja'Marr Chase, and he did so with Mac Jones at QB and Doug Pederson at HC. BTJ has the physical traits to be one of the best WRs in the NFL if he continues his development (primarily just finding the weak spots in zone defense). He's too big and fast for CBs to contain him vertically, and the Jaguars deployed him underneath late in the year to great success. The latter is where new HC Liam Coen was so good at during his stint with the Bucs, and if Travis Hunter is limited to just 66-80% snaps on offense, then there's nothing stopping the 23-year-old from solidifying himself as an annual Round 1 candidate. He was already the WR6 overall in yards per route as an early-declare rookie. 5. RB De'Von Achane (ADP: 14th): He's been a fantasy RB1 in back-to-back years to start his career, but they couldn't have happened in more different ways. Achane's rookie season was a home run derby (7.8 YPC), featuring scores from 25, 67, and 76 yards out. Last year, his rushing efficiency predictably dipped (4.5 YPC), but Achane had the receiving triple crown (78-592-6) among RBs. If we only took the 11 healthy Tua Tagovailoa games, Achane quietly averaged 19.3 half PPR points per game, which would've only trailed Saquon last year. Hopefully Tua can stay upright and the three new starters on the OL (LT Patrick Paul, LG James Daniels, and RG Jonah Savaiinaea) can gel because Achane has the potential to be the RB1 overall finisher if things break his way. On top of this, the Jonnu Smith trade opens up 20% target share (mostly underneath where Achane feasts) and the Jalen Ramsey trade puts the Dolphins in consideration for the very worst CB group in the NFL. What a win. 6. WR Tee Higgins (ADP: 24th): In the most pass-heavy offense in neutral situations (63% pass), Higgins averaged WR4 half PPR points on WR3 overall per-game usage. He's not a math-based regression candidate and nothing has changed, yet he's the WR13 in drafts. Higgins can pay off his ADP with less volume, and if something ever happened to Ja'Marr Chase, Higgins would be a Round 1 value. Joe Burrow is coming off his best season yet, and it's nearly impossible to take away this pass game with his smarts and these two WRs on opposite sides of the field. He's really no different than Drake London at the beginning of Round 2. 7. TE Trey McBride (ADP: 27th): This is the range in the draft where things really drop off, and McBride is the most unique click. After coming back from a minor injury in Week 4, McBride averaged 79 YPG on 9.7 targets per game... and nothing has really changed around him. It's the same QB, HC, OC, OL, and target competition, and that 13-game stint that I just referenced was during a very sustainable 7-6 record from the Cardinals. Perhaps Marvin Harrison takes such a big year two leap that McBride is impacted, but he's a simply more creative YAC player who should still dominate targets underneath. To me, it's more likely that McBride's volume stays relatively the same but his touchdowns positively regress. Nobody ran worse with scores last year (2 receiving touchdowns versus 9.0 expected receiving touchdowns). 8. QB Lamar Jackson (ADP: 32nd): In last year's MVP-caliber campaign, Lamar finished with 8.2 more fantasy points per game than the QB12. The QB1 overall's average points over replacement in previous seasons were 5.6, 8.5, 5.6, and 6.9, so what Lamar accomplished last year was special stuff. In fact, 30% of teams with Lamar last year came in 1st or 2nd place during the regular season, when the baseline for that metric is only 16.7%. The three primary reasons for his explosive season were 1) OC Todd Monken calling a better-schemed and more pass-heavy game plan in his first year calling plays, 2) the addition of Derrick Henry open throwing lanes, and 3) Lamar just getting more comfortable within the pocket. Nothing's changed off that, so I'll take this full round discount from last year's 24th overall per-game finish. He's at the very top of his game right now and has the momentary QB crown until Mahomes brings the deep ball back in my opinion. 9. I removed Omarion Hampton after the LT Rashawn Slater (patella) news. 10. WR Xavier Worthy (ADP: 43rd): The baseline assumption for all 21-year-old early-declare rookies should be their following season will look a whole lot better. That's Worthy, who already showed development during the NFL Playoffs compared to his first few games on the Chiefs. He averaged 74 receiving yards per game over his last 7 games once he was playing 80% of the snaps, and Worthy has the valuable role of being a manufactured touch option while also being the primary downfield threat. The Chiefs are more likely to throw deep this year now that they might have left tackle figured out, and Mahomes' splits with Worthy on the field last year were already drastic. Worthy has a chance to be a high-volume target without Rashee Rice early in the year, and I anticipate him running by plenty of safeties for long scores. I hate to say it, but Worthy is looking like a ""Better In Best Ball"" icon. I'm stunned his ADP hasn't moved off the initial Rice news. 11. QB Jalen Hurts (ADP: 45th): For a bit, Hurts was a 5th-round pick on Underdog. Preposterous. Over the past three seasons since the A.J. Brown trade, Hurts is averaging the 2nd-most fantasy points per game (23.0), only trailing Josh Allen. That's 5.7 more fantasy points per game than the QB12 over that stretch, so this is a real advantage and one that's highly consistent. On top of his historical numbers, Hurts is also playing better each year individually on tape. His play against the blitz was better in 2024, and his decision making is improving going into his age-28 season. We should expect him to get better, not worse, over the next few years. If they have to pass more because game scripts are tighter, Hurts is a stone-cold smash. I wrote about his development here. 12. WR George Pickens (ADP: 48th): His development over the first three years has been notable, and now Pickens has the QB play and offense to allow him to showcase his improved route running skills. He's never run digs or slants really, but Dak Prescott actually throws passes like that, which should allow Pickens to provide yards after catch numbers for his first time. More importantly, Pickens is already productive without that; Pickens has been the WR12 in yards per route over the past two seasons. Start doing the math on what that looks like when he goes from an offense that was 31st in pass attempts (1,005) to 3rd in pass attempts (1,251) over that same two-year sample. Things look good even with CeeDee Lamb healthy. What would happen if it was just Pickens for a stretch? 13. RB Kenneth Walker III (ADP: 50th): Last year's season was spectacular when healthy. Walker led all RBs in forced missed tackles at a true outlier rate, and he did so despite being 48th out of 50 in yards before contact per carry. He was breaking tackles in his own backfield without momentum. I can't stress how impressive that is. He also set career highs in receiving stats, something new OC Klint Kubiak has said he wants to continue: ""I’ve seen the guy catch the ball well out of the backfield, which I think is really important for our backs that we utilize them. Obviously, whatever we can do to get him touches, throwing him routes out of the backfield, throwing him screens."" The Seahawks OL remains problematic, but it should be better than 2024 when RT Abe Lucas missed time and the interior was a disaster. They snagged LG Gray Zabel in Round 1 and have a new C/RG brewing. If that gels at all in a very RB-focused Kubiak offense, Walker has the talent to be one of the most explosive RBs in the NFL. 14. RB Chuba Hubbard (ADP: 53rd): As the clear-cut starter from Weeks 3-16, Hubbard was the RB9 in half PPR points per game despite the Panthers scoring the 23rd-most points while allowing the most points on defense during that span. In other words, the Panthers were mid on offense and rarely had the game script needed to fully go to the moon. Carolina spent the offseason making some minor improvements on defense and sprinkling in a major upgrade at WR with Tetairoa McMillan. The entire OL returns as well, so Hubbard is in a likely better spot for fantasy than he was last year. His workload seems safe for two reasons; he has guaranteed money for the next two seasons, and he is coming off the RB9 season in PFF run grade, RB7 in yards after contact per carry, and the RB6 in 15+ yard carries. If he borders as a top-10 fantasy RB, then Hubbard is a great roster construction pick after snagging an elite WR or two in the first few rounds first. The Panthers want to run the rock. 15. RB Alvin Kamara (ADP: 56th): The 29-year-old's age is very largely priced in, arguably too priced in after his efficiency rebounded last year on a career-high carry total. Kamara was the half PPR's 10th overall player last year. What's new about 2025 is that the Saints OL looks improved and new coach Kellen Moore's has a history of playing with pace. Last year's teams who out-scored their preseason projections had better OLs and OCs than given credit for. That could be true here. Drafting LT Kelvin Banks at 9th overall puts 2023 1st-rounder Taliese Fuaga back to his college side at RT and pushes volatile 1st-rounder inside, where he has C Erik McCoy and RG Cesar Ruiz to help out. Moore's pace has been top-8 in every season and is showing his team fast-break offenses from the NBA as an example this offseason. Are we really sure that 6th-round RB Devin Neal, Kendre Miller, Cam Akers, or CEH is actually going to steal work from Kamara this year? By the way, Kamara has $10M guaranteed in 2026 as well. 16. WR Jauan Jennings (ADP: 64th): Something we learned in our video with Ryan Heath is that first downs per route doesn't improve in these league winning WR seasons, meaning the previous season's FDRR stats are a leading predictor of who is bound to fully breakout the following year (with either more routes or better TD luck). There are a cluster of WRs in this Round 5-6 range who stand out, but Jennings' situation is by far the best. On tape, Jennings is a physical target with a knack for finding the soft spots in zone. He can run most routes well despite having mediocre speed, and Brock Purdy's continued development solidifies his floor. In 8 games when he played above 70% snaps, Jennings averaged 82 yards on a great 2.4 yards per route. If those metric's hold and Jennings can soak up an outlier rate of TDs in an offense projected for the 3rd-most points with the league's easiest schedule, then Jennings is a massive hit at this cost. I don't love the offseason vibes from Brandon Aiyuk either. 17. WR Stefon Diggs (ADP: 74th): Speaking of being very good in first downs per route run ... Is it bold to include a 31-year-old coming off a torn ACL? Probably. But Diggs dodged the PUP list from the jump, was out-running the other Patriots WRs in OTAs, and was the WR7 in ESPN's Open Score last year before his injury. Diggs isn't the same downfield speedster that he was with the Vikings and Bills, but he is still a nasty route runner with great hands and all the experience needed to handle this Josh McDaniels offense. I expect him to clean up on underneath and intermediate routes as a full-time player from Week 1 on. If there's a tangible Drake Maye 2nd-year breakout included, then Diggs can flirt with top-20 numbers in a pretty weak 7th round of fantasy drafts. He's been the WR17 in half PPR points per game over the past two years: 18. Rookie WR Matthew Golden (ADP: 78th): The Packers are on the brink of getting into that great offense tier. Having Jordan Love fully healthy would help, but the real problem with the offense has been the lack of a reliable outside target. Golden's 1st-round draft capital suggests he's their answer to that. He's been participating with the 1st-team offense early in training camp, and if Jayden Reed's lack of 2-WR sets in the previous two seasons are any indication, then Golden has a chance to inch towards a full-time role earlier rather than later. His college tape improved every month, then he lit up the NFL Combine. Golden's start-stop ability and overall body control are the standout trait. He has Post Bye Rookie Bump written all over him. 19. QB Patrick Mahomes (ADP: 85th): This is where Mahomes has finished since being a starter: QB1, QB8 while missing some games, QB4, QB4, QB1, QB8, and most recently QB11. The two years without Tyreek Hill have been his statistical worse, but Xavier Worthy, Rashee Rice, and Hollywood Brown are more in line with the quality of his WR play when he was the QB1 to QB4 for years in a row. The Chiefs are still extremely pass heavy, but they haven't thrown deep in recent years. This 3-WR set could win a 3x100 race across the league, so it feels promising that the downfield production rebounds in 2025. When pocket QBs at discounted prices rebound to a 40+ TD season, they are the best picks in best ball; Joe Burrow last year, Dak Prescott in 2023, Mahomes in 2022, Tom Brady in 2021, and Aaron Rodgers in 2020. If 1st-round LT Josh Simmons plays as well as his July training camp reviews, then Mahomes can join that club once again. He was under the most quick pressure on standard dropbacks last year while LT was a complete mess. 20. Rookie WR Jayden Higgins (ADP: 92nd): We know that rookies offer more upside hits than veterans, and we also know that the McSeanahan tree (McVay + Payton + Shanahan) has been a print fest over the past few years. Higgins gets both trends. Equally as important, Higgins has a path to 3-WR sets in Week 1 and perhaps 2-WR sets by Halloween if he can supplant one-year slot rental Christian Kirk by his in-season play. There's a chance the Texans pass more than they have previously because of the uncertainty around Joe Mixon (foot), Nick Chubb (washed), and the brand new OL. At Iowa State, his 3.2 yards per route vs. man coverage and 91 YPG (33% of his team’s receiving yards) passed all analytical thresholds. Higgins was a ball winner on the perimeter (6'4""/214 with a 39-inch vertical) who can run the vertical routes that C.J. Stroud is good at throwing. His comparison is Michael Pittman, who also went 34th overall in the NFL Draft. 21. WR Rashid Shaheed (ADP: 113th): The 27-year-old is in the prime of his career with some signal in his profile that he can handle more than he's shown. On tape, Shaheed is a demon on vertical routes and snapping those off on deep out routes. That's why he's been a long-TD player for the Saints recently. In fact, over his last 9 healthy games, Shaheed is on a 57-941-9 pace, while averaging 16.6 yards per catch. Before a torn meniscus ended his season short last year, he was the WR17 per game despite not getting any easy completions. Enter OC Kellen Moore, who has weaponized the screen game more than the coaches Shaheed has played under previously. I think he'd be good in this area and would make him a more consistent asset. On top of the new fast-paced play caller, the Saints also have an improved OL which features top-48 picks at all five starting spots. 22. Rookie TE Colston Loveland (ADP: 125th): The Michigan early declare easily was one of my favorite prospects on tape. He at least moves like T.J. Hockenson or Dallas Goedert, but there are moments of his lateral ability looking like a certain ****** *****. Loveland ran translatable routes from inline, the slot, and as a wide receiver. He can be used in the underneath game, but more importantly has the athleticism to be an intermediate target. There's a reason the first skill position move coach Ben Johnson made was drafting him. He's a better version of Sam LaPorta, and there isn't an established top target to Johnson yet. His ADP was suppressed by an offseason shoulder surgery, but Loveland was out there from the get go in camp and immediately sent Cole Kmet to the 2nd team. Even if the Bears are closer to a league average offense, there's enough upside to dream about with Loveland. If the Bears take a massive leap, Loveland can be the late-round TE answer of 2025. 23. QB Anthony Richardson (ADP: 187th): An early offseason shoulder setback allowed Daniel Jones to create some momentum, but then he stepped on the field, and the beat reporters believed Richardson looked better. If these two are close, things should break Richardson's way. Let's say he starts half the year. If he continues with his QB17 average over the past two seasons, that's enough in the last three rounds. If Richardson plays better with another offseason under his belt, then he could be a small win here. If he improves and plays for most of the season, then he's one of the best clicks on the board. There's reasons for some hope with Josh Downs solidifying himself as one of the best slots in the NFL, Michael Pittman healthy after battling a back injury, and with Alec Pierce's game rounding into form. I like Richardson as a QB3 in best ball and anticipate him being in waiver wire discussions at some point in 2025. 24. WR Darius Slayton (ADP: 194th): He's played in the NFL for too long to expect a full breakout, but Slayton can be specifically useful in best ball where we don't have to predict his long receptions. What we should feel confident about is that there will be more opportunities for them with elite bucket thrower Russell Wilson versus Daniel Jones' depleted arm. Slayton said the alert routes are back on the table, and I watched Russ lead George Pickens to the most catchable deep targets in the NFL last year. The Giants know Slayton is better than his per-game stats, which is why he signed a $22M guaranteed contract this past offseason. He'll join Malik Nabers, who is dealing with a toe injury right now, in 2-WR sets over slot-only Wan'Dale Robinson. The 28-year-old has 8 career games with 90+ yards and a score despite playing on terrible offenses. 25. Rookie RB Tahj Brooks (ADP: 206th): There is a time and place for 6th-round rookie optimism. That starts and ends once there's a clear path in place after initial training camp reports, and when that player has some traits to stand on. After Zack Moss's release (neck), only 30-year-old Samaje Perine stands in Brooks way to be the valuable handcuff to Chase Brown. Perine only has two games above 14 carries since 2018, so it'd be Brooks in the event of missed time. Brooks isn't a flashy ballcarrier, but he has a thick build (at least 214 pounds) with some nice lateral ability, even if he's slow. More importantly, Brooks was trusted in pass protection, handled a big workload at Texas Tech, and is a high character player. These prospects never do the three-cone drill at the NFL Combine anymore, but Brooks wasn't scared to compete. For that alone, I'm a fan. Especially in these tournaments where he's been largely undrafted to this point, Brooks is a Round 16-18 target.",2025-08-01,https://underdognetwork.com/football/analysis/the-best-picks-in-2025-fantasy-football-drafts
Fantasy Football Mock Draft: Top 10 Picks for 2025,"As fantasy football enthusiasts gear up for the 2025 NFL season, mock drafts have become an essential tool to gain an edge. Early projections and expert analyses reveal the top players expected to dominate fantasy leagues this year. Based on recent 10-team PPR mock drafts and consensus expert rankings, here’s a breakdown of the top 10 fantasy football picks for 2025 and what makes them so valuable. - Bijan Robinson (RB, Atlanta Falcons) Robinson continues to be the consensus No. 1 overall pick. After an impressive rookie season showcasing elite rushing ability and receiving skills, he’s projected to be the focal point of Atlanta’s offense. His combination of volume, efficiency, and touchdown upside makes him a fantasy juggernaut. Analyst Tom Viera noted, “Bijan is the safest bet at RB1 with his workload and explosive playmaking.” - Ja’Marr Chase (WR, Cincinnati Bengals) Chase remains the top wide receiver off the board, thanks to his dynamic playmaking and connection with Joe Burrow. His ability to produce big plays consistently keeps him in the elite tier. ESPN’s mock drafts show Chase going as early as the second overall pick in some leagues. - Saquon Barkley (RB, Philadelphia Eagles) Despite injury concerns in the past, Barkley’s 2024 resurgence has solidified his status as a top fantasy RB. His dual-threat ability as a rusher and receiver in a high-powered Eagles offense makes him a strong early-round pick. - Jahmyr Gibbs (RB, Detroit Lions) Gibbs’ explosiveness and receiving prowess have fantasy managers excited. His role in Detroit’s offense is expanding, and his receiving yards give him a PPR advantage. Gibbs is often selected in the early first round, reflecting his upside. - Justin Jefferson (WR, Minnesota Vikings) Jefferson’s elite route running and target share keep him among the top WRs. His consistency and big-play ability make him a reliable first-round pick, especially in PPR formats. - Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR, Detroit Lions) St. Brown’s volume and red-zone usage have made him a favorite among fantasy owners. His chemistry with Jared Goff and ability to rack up receptions position him as a top WR6. - Malik Nabers (WR, New York Giants) Nabers’ breakout potential and role in a Giants offense that is expected to be more pass-heavy have analysts bullish. His speed and contested catch ability give him upside as a WR6 or WR7. - CeeDee Lamb (WR, Dallas Cowboys) Lamb’s role as the Cowboys’ primary receiver, combined with his athleticism, keeps him in the first-round conversation. His ability to produce yards after catch makes him a consistent fantasy contributor. - Puka Nacua (WR, Los Angeles Rams) Nacua’s emergence as a reliable target for the Rams has made him a sleeper pick with WR4 upside. His route running and catch rate have impressed coaches and analysts alike. - Ashton Jeanty (RB, Las Vegas Raiders) Jeanty’s rookie campaign showed flashes of brilliance, and his role in the Raiders’ offense is expected to grow. His pass-catching ability and explosiveness make him a valuable PPR asset. Fantasy analyst Steve Gardner commented, “This year’s draft is wide receiver-heavy early, but the value of workhorse running backs like Bijan Robinson and Saquon Barkley cannot be overstated. Versatility and target share are key.” While quarterbacks and tight ends generally come later in drafts, players like Drake Maye (QB, New England Patriots) and Isaiah Likely (TE, Baltimore Ravens) are gaining attention for their upside in deeper leagues. The 2025 fantasy football season promises exciting battles for top draft spots. Managers should prioritize players with high volume and versatility, especially in PPR formats. Starting preparations early with mock drafts can help secure these coveted picks and build championship-caliber teams.",2025-07-09,https://fanarch.com/blogs/nfl/fantasy-football-mock-draft-top-10-picks-for-2025

Who Are the Top 5 Fantasy Football Picks for 2025 Drafts?,"John's top 5 picks for 2025 fantasy football drafts. He lists the players that will be drafted with the first 5 fantasy football picks of next year's drafts. The 2024 NFL regular season is finally over, and it's now time to look back on what happened and try to ascertain how that will affect rankings next year. Of course, there's plenty of time until the 2025 regular season kicks off, as we haven't even made it through the playoffs yet. Still, it's extremely important to nail your first-round draft picks in fantasy football. Failing to do so can often be the difference between winning and losing your championship matchups and playoff games. You also might miss the fantasy postseason altogether. So let's dive into a countdown of the top 5 draft picks for 2025. Be sure to check all of our fantasy football rankings for 2025:- 2025 fantasy football rankings - Running back (RB) fantasy football rankings - Wide receiver (WR) fantasy football rankings - Tight end (TE) fantasy football rankings - Quarterback (QB) fantasy football rankings - Defense (D/ST) fantasy football rankings - NFL rookie fantasy football rankings - Best ball fantasy football rankings - Superflex fantasy football rankings - Dynasty fantasy football rankings 5. Puka Nacua, WR, Los Angeles Rams What he does in the playoffs will probably be important, but he leapfrogs at least a few players here purely because he's so reliable, consistent, and obviously elite. Nacua had some injury issues to start the season but hasn't missed a game since returning in Week 8. Other than a game featuring a terrible ejection decision by the officiating crew, the second-year pro has dominated. Puka Nacua ridiculous numbers pic.twitter.com/hmmSySGZ7o — Football Insights 📊 (@fball_insights) December 13, 2024 His efficiency has been utterly historic. On a yards-per-route-run basis, he is the best zone-beater at WR in the last 11 seasons and the second-best against man coverage. He's the only receiver in the league in that span to post over three YPRR on 75 or more targets in that span. He's playing like one of the best wideouts to ever step foot on the field. Every big catch from Puka Nacua in the Rams win vs Buffalo Short route concepts, his body control, extending the field, jump balls, YAC. Nothing he can’t do. Top 5 WR in football pic.twitter.com/UbbzQB3Xq3 — Football Digest (@FoootballDigest) December 9, 2024 What's even better about that level of efficiency is that it typically signifies that a player can succeed with even more targets. As his fellow WR Cooper Kupp continues to age and fall off, we could see Nacua hyper-targeted even more next season. Quarterback Matthew Stafford would be well-served to break the record for most targets to a player in a season by force-feeding the former BYU Cougar constantly. There don't seem to be any flaws to his game. He has incredible intelligence, is great after the catch, does well on designed rushes, has incredible hands, possesses elite body control, knows how to break down defenses, is difficult to guard in both man and zone coverage, has the complete trust of his quarterback and coaching staff, and more. He should be in the top 5. 4. Bijan Robinson, RB, Atlanta Falcons Robinson proved to be worth the spot he was drafted at by the Falcons in 2023. He had a fantastic season as a trustworthy workhorse running back, carrying the ball 276 times for 1,286 yards and 12 touchdowns and catching 59 passes on 67 targets for 428 yards and one score. He also only fumbled the ball one time. The most impressive run of Bijan’s professional career imo. Shows a jump cut, contact balance and a burst of speed. pic.twitter.com/w2RztclArX — Joe Patrick (@japatrick200) November 10, 2024 His ability to change direction extremely quickly makes it incredibly difficult for linebackers to diagnose plays. He can start and stop on a dime and re-accelerate extremely quickly, putting opposing defenders on skates and forcing them to miss their tackles. He's a legitimate weapon in the receiving game, too. The do-it-all jack-of-all-trades RB is also just 22 years old, and it looks like he has a long and productive career ahead of him. He's in good hands as well. Atlanta's offense features plenty of talented pass-catchers, a solid offensive line, and a rookie quarterback in Michael Penix Jr. who's flashed serious potential. The way Bijan is able to subtly cut in the open field and put defenders on the ground is always breathtaking. pic.twitter.com/CwdExY5aHv — Dan Why-Ner (@ReallyDanWeiner) January 5, 2025 He doesn't have elite speed, but he's fast enough, and his change of direction ability allows him to consistently make more out of plays than he's given. RBs don't always need to be elite home run hitters to excel. His volume is extremely safe as long as he's healthy. 3. Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings The quarterback situation has yet to be resolved for 2025 in Minnesota, but for the most part, it doesn't matter too much. Whether the team decides to extend quarterback Sam Darnold isn't particularly relevant. Even if rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy (knee) ends up starting next year, JJettas should continue to play at an elite level. He is the best WR in the NFL. JUSTIN JEFFERSON 97-YARD TD ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?! 🤯 UNREAL THROW 😳 (via @NFL) pic.twitter.com/HwfQuQnPbB— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) September 15, 2024 He is completely uncoverable and has been elite every year no matter who has been the signal-caller. His route-running savvy and explosiveness out of his breaks make it impossible for opposing defensive backs to cover him. The Canton-bound pass-catcher has been a model of consistency, as he currently holds the record for most receiving yards per game in a career, at 96.5. Any QB who plays for the Vikings will know their No. 1 job is to get the ball to Jefferson, who will be open early and often. Safe to say if Minny's quarterback was Joe Burrow, JJ would be the undisputed No. 1 pick in fantasy football for 2025. 2. Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles While we have our reservations about spending early picks on running backs coming off of massive volume seasons, Barkley is just 27 years old, and as Baltimore Ravens RB Derrick Henry has shown, backs can still have great seasons even into their late 20s and early 30s. Barkley was elite this season, putting up seven games of 25 or more PPR fantasy points on the year. Saquan Barkley just MARCHED OFF on the Saints for a 65 Yard Touchdown 🤯 Give him good blocking and he is a great RB. Give him this blocking and he can be legendary. @saquon pic.twitter.com/bOuuQdtkHD — Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) September 22, 2024 It shouldn't be much of a surprise that this happened. He went from an absolute poverty franchise, the New York Giants, to a team with an elite offensive line. His production also came naturally. He was able to get in space more often and use his elite speed, contact balance, and elusiveness to shred defenses for huge gains consistently. Saquon Barkley’s top 8 plays this season: A thread: 🪡 🧵 No. 8: long run vs Buccaneers — SaquonMuse⚡️ (@MuseSaquon) December 20, 2024 His highlight reel from this season is utterly insane. 1. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals To no one's surprise, the Triple Crown winner from 2024 will probably be the first overall pick in 2025. Chase tallied 127 catches on an insane 175 targets for 1708 yards and 17 touchdowns, scoring 22 PPR fantasy points per game. He had three games where he detonated for over 40 PPR FPTs. BURROW TO JA'MARR CHASE 67-YD TOUCHDOWN 🔥 NOBODY COULD CATCH HIM 😤 (via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/g25Wv3jKNg — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) November 8, 2024 Chase has a lot of things going for him. He has one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Burrow. He's a ""just get the ball in his hands"" type of player because he's so great after the catch. His elite physicality makes it extremely hard to guard him in man coverage, and Burrow's ability to surgically dice up zone coverage makes it a bad idea to run those defenses. Burrow isn't going anywhere, and Chase isn't either. With the Bengals having such a poor defense, we may see them need to pass the ball early and often next year yet again. Hopefully, the No. 1 overall pick curse ends in 2025. Still, he's one of the NFL's best wideouts paired with one of the best QBs, so he should be taken first overall next season.

20 Must-Have Fantasy Football Draft Targets (2025),"When it comes to building a championship-caliber fantasy football roster, targeting the right players on draft day is everything. That’s why we’ve asked our collection of Featured Pros – a trusted group of top-ranked fantasy football experts – to share their must-have draft targets for the 2025 season. These are the players our experts are circling on their cheat sheets across all formats, whether it’s a league-winning RB, breakout WR, or a late-round sleeper with massive upside. If you want to walk away from your draft feeling confident, this expert-approved list is the perfect place to start. - More Fantasy Football Tips & Advice - 2025 Fantasy Football Expert Rankings - Fantasy Football Dynasty Rankings - Fantasy Football Trade Tools Must-Have Fantasy Football Draft Targets What one RB outside the top 30 in the expert consensus are you hoping to end up with in all your leagues and why? Javonte Williams (RB – DAL) “I expect Javonte Williams to start the season as the lead Cowboys RB in a workhorse role. How long that role lasts is a different question, but hovering around 20 opportunities per game, in a high-powered Dallas offense, for at least half the year, will definitely return value on an ADP of RB36. For the record- Neither 5th Round Pick Jaydon Blue nor depth piece Mile Sanders are screaming “bell cow RB”. Javonte, in the prime of his career at just 25 years old, is reminding me a ton of 2024 Chuba Hubbard as we enter fantasy draft season.” – Joe Orrico (No Expert Fantasy Football) “I’m targeting Javonte Williams (RB37) outside the top 30. His late-season surge in 2024 showed he’s regaining his pre-injury explosiveness, and a new home in Dallas with little backfield competition makes his current ADP a steal for the value he could provide. With a favorable schedule and potential for increased goal-line work, he’s a high-upside RB3 with RB2 potential. His current ADP makes him a steal for the value he could provide.” – Aaron St Denis (Fantasy Sports Advice Network) MarShawn Lloyd (RB – GB) “MarShawn Lloyd is a high-upside handcuff that’s practically free in drafts. He had tough injury luck as a rookie, but is healthy now. Lloyd was an exciting prospect coming out of USC and is the odds-on favorite to win the No. 2 RB job in a strong offense behind a 27-year-old RB coming off a season with over 350 total touches. Josh Jacobs has missed time in four of his six NFL campaigns.” – Jared Smola (Draft Sharks) Zach Charbonnet (RB – SEA) “Zach Charbonnet is a must-have for any Kenneth Walker manager, and even has tons of appeal stand-alone. When Walker missed time a year ago, Charbonnet came in and looked the part (and then some) of a starting running back. With Walker out, Charbonnet finished as an RB1 on three separate occasions. Now, with Seattle looking to become a more run-first offense, there could be some pathway towards Charbonnet getting more work, even if Walker is healthy. Take Walker out of the equation, and Charbonnet has league winner written all over him.” – Ed Birdsall (Talking Points Sports) “Zach Charbonnet is an early target of mine. He’s probably just as talented as Kenneth Walker and will likely have a role even when Walker is healthy. And given Walker’s injury history, Charbonnet should sometimes have the backfield to himself. It’s also possible that Charbonnet could impress the new coaching staff and ascend to the starting job.” – Scott Pianowski (Yahoo! Sports) Jaylen Wright (RB – MIA) “Jaylen Wright, the Miami Dolphins’ explosive second-year running back, is a must-have fantasy football draft target for 2025 due to his untapped potential in one of the NFL’s most dynamic offenses. With Raheem Mostert cut this offseason and De’Von Achane‘s injury history, Wright is poised to step into a significant role, potentially as the RB2 or even challenging for RB1 duties. His elite speed (4.38 40-yard dash) and big-play ability (7.4 yards per carry in college) perfectly complement Mike McDaniel’s outside-zone scheme, which led the NFL in RB PPR points per game in 2024. Wright’s pass-blocking prowess, highlighted as the best among 2024 rookie RBs, ensures he’ll see the field in critical situations, boosting his three-down potential. At a low ADP (RB49, Round 12), he’s a high-upside lottery ticket who could deliver top-25 RB production if opportunity strikes, making him a steal for savvy drafters.” – Brandon Murchison (RotoBaller) Jaydon Blue (RB – DAL) “Jaydon Blue (RB54 in the rankings) will be one of my highest-rostered running backs in redraft leagues this season. The former Texas star was a Day 3 pick but landed in an excellent situation for his fantasy value. Last year, Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders ranked in the bottom 16 among 70 running backs with at least 55 rushing attempts in yards per attempt. Furthermore, both veterans averaged 2.51 or fewer rushing yards per attempt last season. While it might be too early to call him the next De’Von Achane, Blue could have a similar rookie year to the star running back with two ineffective veterans ahead of him on the depth chart. Therefore, there is no reason he should be ranked behind running backs who need an injury to start, like Jaylen Wright (RB49) and Jerome Ford (RB53), when Blue could earn the starting role before Week 1.” – Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros) Cam Skattebo (RB – NYG) “Cam Skattebo has a strong chance to start for the Giants’ offense in Week 1. Despite being a Day 3 pick, he brings a physical running style and the ability to run through defenders, making him a valuable addition to New York’s backfield. His PPR upside is evident from his college career, where he recorded 45 receptions for 605 yards and 3 touchdowns, including a standout 99-yard receiving performance in last year’s Peach Bowl against Texas. His three-down potential gives him an opportunity to carve out a high-volume role, with his combination of physicality, receiving ability, and playmaking setting him up for long-term success. Skattebo is a strong dynasty target outside the Top 30, making him a player worth adding across all fantasy formats.” – Lawrence Iacona (Gridiron Experts) Jordan Mason (RB – MIN) “The Minnesota Vikings traded for Jordan Mason this offseason, and he is one Aaron Jones injury away from a full workload. The Vikings didn’t draft any backs in this year’s draft, and Ty Chandler fell out of favor on the depth chart last season. This is going to be a two-headed monster in Minnesota behind a revamped interior offensive line that has done nothing but upgrade with the acquisitions of Ryan Kelly, Will Fries, and Donovan Jackson. In addition to finishing fourth in yards over expected per attempt and seventh in rushing yards after contact last season, Mason ranked second in total rushing yards (667) before his injury in Week 8. I fully expect Mason to take on a larger role near the goal line, given that Jones struggled immensely in this area in 2024 (-14.4 EPA generated in goal-to-goal situations last season).” – Andrew Erickson (FantasyPros) “Jordan Mason is going to be a middle-round target for me. I think he’ll be a hand-in-glove for Kevin O’Connell’s zone-heavy run scheme. Aaron Jones is going to be the starter, but Mason could get enough work to have stand-alone value, and if the 30-year-old Jones were to miss any time, Mason’s value would skyrocket. We saw how valuable Mason was when Christian McCaffrey missed time early last season. Over the first five weeks of the season, before he sustained a shoulder injury in Week 6, Mason was averaging 107.2 rushing yards a game and 5.1 yards per carry for the 49ers, making him the RB5 in half-point PPR fantasy scoring over that stretch. Mason is a sneaky-good value in the early double-digit rounds.” – Pat Fitzmaurice (FantasyPros) “Jordan Mason is likely to be the chalky answer here… at least to my mind. Mason lands in an excellent offensive scheme in Minnesota with a novice QB in need of run support to help him through his first season as the starter. Aaron Jones is the incumbent RB, but he’s entering his age-30 season and earned the most touches of his career in 2024. Clearly, Kevin O’Connell and the Vikings staff sought to both limit his workload and add a bigger-bodied back for short-yardage and goal-line situations. I like Jones enough, but Mason’s value as the current RB40 is too good to pass up.” – Jeremy Shulman (Fantasy Football Universe) Bhayshul Tuten (RB – JAC) “The word on the street, per Jeremy Fowler at ESPN, is that the new regime in Jacksonville is not very high on RB Travis Etienne. Remember, it was former Jaguars’ GM Trent Baalke who drafted Etienne, not current GM James Gladstone. Gladstone drafted Bhayshul Tuten, and I expect him to be the best fantasy RB in Jacksonville, as long as Tuten can cure his fumbling issues, which cropped up in college. When it comes to Bhayshul “Rootin'” Tuten, he’s the fastest RB north, south, east, and west of the Pecos, in the 2025 NFL Draft, according to Yosemite Sam Ringo. Ringo’s comp- Tuten reminds me of a lighter version of former Bronco and Redskin RB, Clinton Portis.” – Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts) Travis Etienne Jr. (RB – JAC) “I will have 100% rostership of Travis Etienne Jr. if his current value remains the same throughout the rest of this offseason. Etienne was the RB6 in FPPG in 2023, and now he has Liam Coen calling plays for him. Even if Tank Bigsby and Etienne are splitting the backfield, we just saw what Coen could do in Tampa Bay with Rachaad White and Bucky Irving, who were back-to-back in FPPG last season. Etienne has the highest ceiling out of any of the running backs that you can currently get outside of the FantasyPros expert consensus top 30 running backs.” – Nick Penticoff (Fantasy Football Astronauts) Najee Harris (RB – PIT) “I think Najee Harris at RB33 is a great steal. Harris has gotten 1,000 yards per season every season he’s been in the NFL. Granted, those were all with the Steelers, and he’s on the Chargers now, but I still think he’s got something in the tank. The team drafted Omarion Hampton, so Harris’s upside is limited. I’m not succumbing to the rookie fever here. Instead, I’m taking the vet at his discounted price.” – Andrew Hall (FantasyPros) What one WR outside the top 30 in the expert consensus are you hoping to end up with in all your leagues and why? Cooper Kupp (WR – SEA) “I don’t believe Kupp is “washed.” Injury-prone, yes. But no longer capable of scoring fantasy points, no. Weeks 8-14 Last Year Per Game: 18.0 Fantasy Points (WR4), 27.4% Target Share (WR11). Still Producing. Still Demanding Targets. New QB Sam Darnold Supported BOTH Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison as Top 5 WRs Weeks 9-17. Kupp’s ADP of WR34 bakes in his injury risk- the perfect cost!” – Joe Orrico (No Expert Fantasy Football) Rashid Shaheed (WR – NO) “Rashid Shaheed was producing as a top-24 fantasy WR before last year’s Week 6 knee injury. There are QB questions in New Orleans heading into 2025. But Shaheed is the clear No. 2 WR and got a coaching upgrade with the arrival of Kellen Moore. All six of Moore’s NFL offenses have topped 65 plays per game. For perspective, only four teams topped 65 plays per game last year.” – Jared Smola (Draft Sharks) Ricky Pearsall (WR – SF) “It feels like an eternity since Ricky Pearsall was selected in the 1st round by the 49ers, given everything the young man has gone through since then. Entering his sophomore season, the skies couldn’t be any more perfect for a Pearsall breakout. Deebo Samuel is in Washington, and Brandon Aiyuk is still recovering from the knee injury he suffered a year ago. Pearsall will have to contend with Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, and Jauan Jennings for targets early on, yet despite the competition for targets, there is no doubt that Pearsall could become a regular on offense for San Francisco.” – Ed Birdsall (Talking Points Sports) “Ricky Pearsall is a must-have fantasy football draft target for the San Francisco 49ers in 2025, as his late-2024 surge and an evolving team dynamic position him for a breakout. In his final two games of 2024, Pearsall amassed 14 receptions on 18 targets for 210 yards and two touchdowns, showcasing his ability to capitalize on increased opportunities with a 77.8% catch rate and 11.7 yards per target. With Deebo Samuel traded to the Washington Commanders and Brandon Aiyuk potentially sidelined early due to a torn ACL, Pearsall is projected to step into a starting WR2 role, boosting his target share in Kyle Shanahan’s high-octane offense, which ranked top-5 in passing efficiency in 2024. His 64.1 PFF receiving grade and low 3.1% drop rate as a rookie highlight his reliability, while his versatility, evidenced by three rushes for 45 yards, adds flex appeal. Currently undervalued with an ADP of WR45 (Round 8-9), Pearsall’s elite athletic profile (4.41 40-yard dash, 6.64 3-cone) and the 49ers’ easy 2025 pass schedule make him a steal with WR2 upside.” – Brandon Murchison (RotoBaller) “Ricky Pearsall (WR45 in the rankings) will be my favorite 49ers wide receiver to pick in redraft leagues this year. Unfortunately, he missed the first six weeks recovering from a gunshot during an attempted robbery during the preseason. Yet, the former Florida star was outstanding when getting the ball, averaging 18.6 half-point PPR fantasy points per game in the three contests with six or more targets, scoring three receiving touchdowns. San Francisco traded away Deebo Samuel this offseason, while Brandon Aiyuk is coming off a torn ACL and MCL. The fact that Pearsall is the lowest of the 49ers’ top three wide receivers in the rankings makes me want to draft him all the more.” – Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros) Khalil Shakir (WR – BUF) “Khalil Shakir is a boring pick, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be a good pick. The Bills didn’t add anything major to the WR room, which sets up Shakir for an easy 80-plus catches. He’s unlikely to ever dominate the touchdown column, but last year’s haul (four) was probably a little unlucky. You’ll get Shakir as a WR4 or WR5 in many leagues, and that’s screaming profit.” – Scott Pianowski (Yahoo! Sports) Matthew Golden (WR – GB) “Matthew Golden’s elite speed, route-running precision, and versatility make him a seamless fit for the Packers’ offensive system, which mirrors many of the concepts he thrived in at Texas. The Longhorns’ RPO-heavy, run-balanced scheme emphasized quick decision-making, deep-threat opportunities, and spacing, all of which align with Matt LaFleur’s offensive philosophy in Green Bay. Golden’s ability to stretch the field, create separation, and adjust to defensive coverages will allow him to transition quickly and become a key weapon for Jordan Love. His experience in motion-heavy formations and vertical passing concepts ensures he won’t take long to master the Packers’ playbook. Golden is a must-target WR outside the Top 30, offering both immediate production and long-term upside.” – Lawrence Iacona (Gridiron Experts) Tetairoa McMillan (WR – CAR) “I’m targeting Tetairoa McMillan (WR34) outside the top 30 ADP on FantasyPros. As a rookie, his elite route-running and athleticism make him a high-upside pick in Carolina’s evolving offense. With potential for a significant role in 2025, he could emerge as a key target for Bryce Young, especially in half-PPR formats. His current ADP offers great value for a possible WR2 with WR1 upside.” – Aaron St Denis (Fantasy Sports Advice Network) “Carolina drafted Tetairoa McMillan 8th overall, inserting him into a Panthers offense in need of a true WR1. If Bryce Young takes even a modest step forward in Year 3 and continues to fuel fantasy success for his No. 1 target, McMillan could be this year’s breakout rookie receiver. Note that Adam Thielen surpassed both 100 catches and 1,000 receiving yards during Young’s rookie season. Last year in Dave Canales’ offense, the Panthers’ No. 1 WR between Diontae Johnson/Thielen was pacing for over 1,100 receiving yards over a 17-game sample size (33% first-read target share).” – Andrew Erickson (FantasyPros) Calvin Ridley (WR – TEN) “Despite dealing with wretched quarterbacking last year, Calvin Ridley finished with 1,017 receiving yards and was WR27 in fantasy scoring. From Week 8 on, he was WR16. Now he gets to play with No. 1 draft pick Cam Ward, who has a terrific arm and is no shrinking violet with regard to throwing aggressively downfield. The Titans don’t exactly have an abundance of pass-catching talent, so Ridley figures to lead the team in targets by a mile. Ridley’s ECR of WR36 suggests he’ll be a bargain in 2025 fantasy drafts.” – Pat Fitzmaurice (FantasyPros) Travis Hunter (WR, DB – JAC) “I don’t think some of the fantasy football analysts realize just how talented Travis Hunter is, because if they did, they’d rank him a hell of a lot higher. In my humble opinion, the most talented wide receiver in Jacksonville isn’t Brian Thomas Jr.; it’s Travis Hunter. Hunter is tougher with contested catches and is a better route runner. The only concern I have is how many snaps he’ll play, but with a current consensus ranking of only WR 32, I’ll roll the dice based on his talent alone. That’s in Ringo’s draft neighborhood- very talented players who don’t cost a lot. Ringo’s comp- a lighter version of Ja’Marr Chase.” – Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts) “Travis Hunter is currently ranked as the half PPR WR32. That won’t last through the summer, but I’ll scoop up his value while it’s still too low. Hunter was selected with the 2nd overall pick in the NFL Draft by a team that traded up to acquire his services. He enters a situation with only one true alpha target earner and plenty of players and coaches with something to prove on the offensive side of the ball. Liam Coen and the Jags will scheme up a ton of plays for Hunter while gamescripting heavy workloads for him in mismatch situations from week to week. He has a pretty solid floor and a blow-the-roof-off ceiling and is going around names like Chris Olave, Jaylen Waddle, and Jordan Addison. Of these players, only Hunter has the skill and the top-tier situation to be your fantasy squad’s weekly WR1.” – Jeremy Shulman (Fantasy Football Universe) Darnell Mooney (WR – ATL) “Darnell Mooney quietly had 992 receiving yards and five touchdowns last season. Mooney would have had his 2nd 1,000-yard season of his career, but he missed the final regular season game with an injury. Michael Penix Jr. ranked 1st in accurate throw percentage on passes of 20+ yards last season. Mooney ranked 10th in receiving yards on passes of 20+ yards. Drake London is the WR1 on this team, and Kyle Pitts might mess around and outplay his rookie season for the first time since he entered the league, but Darnell Mooney is someone who could easily have over 1,000 yards and anywhere from 8-10 receiving touchdowns this season. I expect him to be a low-end WR2 this year with WR1 weekly upside.” – Nick Penticoff (Fantasy Football Astronauts) Rome Odunze (WR – CHI) “Rome Odunze at WR37 feels like tremendous value to me. Keenan Allen is currently a free agent, making Odunze the #2 option behind DJ Moore on the Bears. They drafted Luther Burden as well, but Odunze was drafted higher and has a year of experience under his belt. I understand that rookies are fun to draft, but give me the more talented player at the lower price all day.” – Andrew Hall (FantasyPros) Subscribe: YouTube | Spotify | Apple Podcasts | iHeart | Castbox | Amazon Music | Podcast Addict | TuneIn",2025-05-20,https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/05/20-must-have-fantasy-football-draft-targets-2025/

Even though we all have that moment after a fantasy football draft where we say to ourselves, “Nailed it,” it’s not really perfect. We won’t hit perfection because the draft will evolve differently depending on where we are picking. What I aim to do is provide you with my favorite range to draft from and create the best-case scenarios to build the perfect draft. You can practice for your “Perfect Draft” using our FREE mock draft simulator. For my perfect draft, we will go with pick 10. It’s fair to look at this as more of an 8-11 range of guys, based on a 12-team half-PPR format. Let’s get to drafting! Perfect Fantasy Football Draft: Strategy, Advice & Targets (2025) Round 1 Thomas comes in at WR8 and 12th overall in the half-PPR ranks. He finished 4th among wide receivers. He was WR7 from week 10 on and the third-highest ranked wideout from weeks 13 on. The offense should be humming in the air, and Thomas is going to expand on his 133 targets. Thomas might reach 100 catches this year and can easily contend with Tier 1 at the position. There are some other guys I don’t mind in this territory, but unless Malik Nabers or Puka Nacua fall, Brian Thomas is an incredible way to start your draft. Round 2 There is no doubt that McCaffrey is polarizing in fantasy. He comes in at RB7 and 15th overall, but some have him ranked top 5 at RB, while others have him outside the top 12. As polarizing as he is, it’s easy for me; you’re either worried about the injury history or look past it because of his talent and the offense. In 2023, McCaffrey was the RB1 in half-PPR by a wide margin. The Niners will throw him the ball, but don’t implement enough of a rotation to justify a loss of carries to hurt him. He is too talented and is one of the easiest bets of a second-round RB who could be number one overall. Round 3 Fields in at QB opens up the possibilities of directions Wilson could go, but he will stand alone as the primary target. We’ve seen Fields favor the top WR in his offense, which opens up the chance that Wilson not only can get 150 targets again, but surpass that number. Fields’ ability to open up defenses because of his legs really does work well for Wilson, who can play it deep or across the middle. Davante Adams and JSN are also options here if they fall. Round 4 Two Jets on a team might raise some eyebrows, but Hall is shaping up to be a really solid value. Aaron Glenn does throw out the multi-back thing, but if I get 20 touches a game out of Breece, I feel confident there is top 10 RB upside. Over his last six games of the season, Breece received 20 or more touches three times (using targets as touches here). In those three 20-touch games, he finished as RB3, RB8, and RB19. His receiving and rushing upside in an offense that will be more productive stands out in this range, and puts him as an ideal RB2 on my team. James Cook and Ken Walker are two potential pivots here as well if Breece is gone. Round 5 Tetairoa McMillan (WR – CAR) This five/six turn I really like. Tetairoa McMillon as my WR3 is ideal. He comes in as WR29 and around the 60s of overall ADP. He was a target machine in college, and I expect him to be littered with targets this season. Brian Thomas is a good gauge of where McMillon could be headed. I feel more comfortable about that, as Bryce Young turned his game around in the second half. Round 6 The pairing of McMillon with Waddle is why I love this turn so much. McMillon’s ADP can fluctuate based on the risk that people are willing to take. Seeing as I have secured my two RBs, I can now pair the rookie with a veteran like Waddle, which makes so much sense. The Dolphins’ moving to more run-oriented game planning last season took most of us by surprise. Injuries definitely played a role in that. Waddle and Hill were also affected by Jonnu Smith‘s rise. Now that Jonnu is gone, and Hill is a year older, I think we are headed back to big Waddle target shares. Waddle is actually WR28 and ranked overall a few spots above Tet, but I am prioritizing the young upside first Round 7 This scenario doesn’t really work for the elite tight ends, but getting Kelce in the 7th is right where the last few usable tight ends go. There is no doubt Kelce has lost a step, but despite that, he still caught 97 balls. Weeks 1-10, he ranked as TE3 in PPR, and is in line for some positive touchdown regression, as his three touchdowns were the least of any full season of his career. The suspension of Rashee Rice gives an added boost in the red zone as well. If I missed on Kelce, I would give a strong look at Evan Engram here or even Mark Andrews, sticking with the Tight End position. Round 8 I am not against elite QBs, so don’t think this is me screaming for late-round QBs, but based on my strategy, that is how it plays out. There are scenarios where a Kyler Murray can fall, but adding in yet another Jet (maybe I should be a little more worried about my perfect draft), Justin Fields is the target. I’ve already laid out his main targets, are guys I want, but throw in the offensive line, Fields is put in his best position yet to succeed. His rushing upside makes him a weekly top 10 QB, and I am not afraid to reach a little to get him, and then pair with a veteran QB a little later, as I have laid out. Round 9 Brandon Aiyuk is hurt, Jauan Jennings is now wanting a new deal or shipping out of San Francisco, and Ricky is just sitting here saying throw me the ball. I am a big Jauan Jennings guy, but this is the type of distraction that can give Pearsall a leg up. He’s explosive with the ball in his hands and might be their new Deebo. Get it in his hands and let him do the work after the catch. He also provides the ability to stretch the field. This is important because Kittle and McCaffrey will take up some defensive attention. In this scenario, we are getting Pearsall as our fifth wideout, and that is the type of upside that you want. Since we are in bench range, I am also looking at Stefon Diggs, Josh Downs, Cooper Kupp, and Cam Skattebo. Round 10 He’s becoming everyone’s favorite sleeper, and it’s because he is a menace with the ball in his hands. Aaron Jones is getting older, not super efficient near the goal line, and can’t put up a workhorse load. Jones is young and can do all of the above. He is behind Jones, but that may not stick this season, and more importantly, he has in-season value. He should see double-digit touches on a weekly basis, regardless of Aaron Jones’ status. I am comfortable with Jones, but if I felt dicey, I might have reached for Javonte Williams a round earlier, or maybe even go Javonte and Mason to have four good backs. Unlock positional rankings, tiered cheat sheets, perfect draft blueprints, and exclusive player intel with the 2025 Fantasy Football Draft Kit — everything you need to draft with confidence. Later Round Targets Instead of locking into specific players here, here are some of my later-round/bench options. I am considering second quarterbacks in this situation, given that I took Justin Fields. Had I taken a Joe Burrow, we wouldn’t worry too much. I’d like to walk out of my draft with at least one of those three running backs, Guerrendo and Blue being the top two options. There are some great late wideouts to target, and like the RBs, if I can get two of these options, I am going to be set on my bench with huge upside. There you have it. My perfect draft from an ideal spot. As I mentioned, we could build a few other perfect drafts from other spots. Having a top-three or four pick and then having some value drop could create an amazing scenario as well. Experiment and create your perfect draft with FantasyPros Draft Simulator right now.

"2025 Fantasy football draft prep: Rankings, strategy, rookies, best advice, top 150 players by NFL insiders","2025 Fantasy football draft prep: Rankings, strategy, rookies, best advice, top 150 players by NFL insiders SportsLine's 2025 Fantasy football draft guide includes Fantasy football auction values, keeper advice, mock drafts and more Part of what makes Fantasy football exciting every year is tracking player movement from the season before and understanding how certain moves can benefit your Fantasy team. In some cases, those moves create more uncertainty as a player can join an already deep and talented position group on his new team. A reliable set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you navigate such moves, but when it comes to your Fantasy football draft prep, you can never have too much helpful information.

Head to SportsLine now to see the 2025 Fantasy football draft bible. Top 2025 Fantasy football picks The Fantasy football draft bible features 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, including: Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins: Tagovailoa has been a top-16 quarterback per game in three consecutive seasons, finishing in the top five in passing yards per game each year. The veteran signal caller is now heading into Year 4 in Mike McDaniel's offense, and with top wideouts Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle returning, the stage is set for Tagovailoa to hit the ground running in 2025. ""Tagovailoa finished 13th in Fantasy points per game among regular starters last year, and he consistently scores around 20 points per game when healthy,"" White said. ""With Jonnu Smith gone, Tagovailoa should return to more downfield shots to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, which gives him a solid shot at finishing in the 10-12 range at the position, well ahead of his average draft position."" Jordan Mason, RB, Minnesota Vikings: Mason impressed out of the gate last year with Christian McCaffrey unavailable for the 49ers, rushing for 685 yards on 134 rushing attempts and three scores during the team's first eight games. Boasting a far larger frame at 5-foot-11, 223 pounds, Mason could also be the favorite for short-yardage and goal-line work for the Vikings this season, making him an intriguing Fantasy football sleeper. ""Mason looked great as a complementary player in his first two seasons in San Francisco but was dominant as the team's lead back in the first half of 2024, pacing to a 1,620-yard season over the first seven weeks while suffering a shoulder injury late in that stretch,"" White noted. ""Aaron Jones set a career high for rushing yards and a career low in yards per attempt last year, and he turns 31 in December. If Jones starts to show his age or gets banged up at any point, Mason could run away with the RB1 job and become a top-10 Fantasy asset once again.""

"Early 2025 Fantasy Football Projections for NFLSZN: QB, RB, WR, & TE","As the 2024 NFL season ends, it’s never too early to start diving into the 2025 fantasy football projections to get an edge. Below, we’ll take a look at projections for some of the top players in fantasy football for the 2025 season. Top fantasy football running backs include Bijan Robinson and Saquon Barkley, both expected to see heavy workloads in 2025. Rising star WRs Brian Thomas Jr. and Malik Nabers are likely to be top fantasy football WR picks next year. Meanwhile, dual-threat QBs like Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Jayden Daniels will be big targets for fantasy football owners. The 2025 NFL season is already heating up with NFLSZN on PrizePicks! Now’s your chance to make season-long predictions on your favorite players. Will they go ore or less than their projected stats for the entire 2025 season? Whether it’s passing yards, touchdowns, or other key stats, the choice is yours! Build your ideal 2025 fantasy football squad under the NFLSZN tab in the PrizePicks app and win real money if your picks are correct. The season will be here before you know it, so don’t miss this opportunity to put your football knowledge to the test and cash in on your predictions! 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: Quarterbacks Here are some of the top 2025 fantasy football projections from quarterbacks, via the NFLSZN board on PrizePicks — the NFL season-long real money game. Eagles QB Jalen Hurts 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 3,199.5 Pass Yards, 19.5 Pass TDs, 574.5 Rush Yards, 12.5 Rush TDs In his four seasons as a starter, Eagles QB Jalen Hurts has never finished with fewer than 605 rushing yards in a season. Yet, PrizePicks currently sets his 2025 rushing total at 574.5 yards. Even with RB Saquon Barkley in the backfield, Hurts’ rushing workload remained steady, recording 150 carries despite missing two games due to injury. A key factor in his rushing production is Philadelphia’s signature ‘tush push’ — their nearly unstoppable quarterback sneak. Over the past three seasons, Hurts has averaged 14 rushing touchdowns per year, and Barkley’s presence hasn’t cut into those opportunities. Instead, it helped the Eagles reach the red zone more often, as they had 30 more red-zone drives in 2024 compared to the previous season, per Footballguys. Hurts has surpassed his 12.5 rushing TDs projection for NFLSZN on PrizePicks in each of the last three seasons. With his established rushing volume and a system built to maximize his strengths, Hurts remains a top threat on the ground heading into 2025. Commanders QB Jayden Daniels 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 3,300 Pass Yards, 24 Pass TDs, 849.5 Rush Yards, 6.5 Rush TDs It’s no secret that Commanders QB Jayden Daniels lacks reliable receiving targets, with WR Terry McLaurin being his only true threat against opposing defenses. Many 2025 NFL Mock Drafts have the Commanders trading up to select Ohio State WR Emeka Egbuka or another receiver, adding much-needed firepower to their offense. While the Commanders have several roster gaps to address — whether it’s bolstering the offensive line to protect Daniels or strengthening the secondary — they must prioritize surrounding their young quarterback with more weapons. After an impressive rookie campaign in which Daniels threw for 3,568 yards and 25 touchdowns, some consider it one of the best first-year performances by a quarterback in NFL history. However, entering his second season, Daniels may face some natural regression as defenses adjust and have more film to study. The moves Washington makes this offseason, through the NFL Draft and free agency, will be key indicators of what to expect from him in 2025. 🏈 Check out the top NFL QBs in 2025 Free Agency, including Sam Darnold and Aaron Rodgers More 2025 Fantasy Football QB Projections Here are more 2025 fantasy football QB projections via NFLSZN on PrizePicks. - Lions QB Jared Goff: 4,224.5 Pass Yards, 29.5 Pass TDs - Bengals QB Joe Burrow: 4,149.5 Pass Yards, 33.5 Pass TDs - Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes: 3,999.5 Pass Yards, 27.5 Pass TDs - Buccaneers QB Baker Mayfield: 3,824.5 Pass Yards, 28.5 Pass TDs - Texans QB C.J. Stroud: 3,799.5 Pass Yards, 24.5 Pass TDs - Cowboys QB Dak Prescott: 3,874.5 Pass Yards, 26.5 Pass TDs - Bills QB Josh Allen: 3,750.5 Pass Yards, 27.5 Pass TDs - Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence: 3,574.5 Pass Yards, 21.5 Pass TDs - Packers QB Jordan Love: 3,599.5 Pass Yards, 26.5 Pass TDs - Chargers QB Justin Herbert: 3,699.5 Pass Yards, 22.5 Pass TDs - Ravens QB Lamar Jackson: 3,449.5 Pass Yards, 28.5 Pass TDs - Bears QB Caleb Williams: 3,449.5 Pass Yards, 24.5 Pass TDs - Broncos QB Bo Nix: 3,424.5 Pass Yards, 22.5 Pass TDs - Falcons QB Michael Penix: 3,424.5 Pass Yards, 22.5 Pass TDs - Cardinals QB Kyler Murray: 3,399.5 Pass Yards, 20.5 Pass TDs - Panthers QB Bryce Young: 3,299.5 Pass Yards, 18.5 Pass TDs - Patriots QB Drake Maye: 3,249.5 Pass Yards, 21.5 Pass TDs 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: Running Backs Here are some of the top 2025 fantasy football projections from running back, via the NFLSZN board on PrizePicks — the NFL season-long real money game. Falcons RB Bijan Robinson 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 1,249.5 Rush Yards, 10.5 Rush TDs, 2.5 Rec TDs Falcons RB Bijan Robinson quietly put together an outstanding 2024 fantasy season, finishing as the RB3 in PPR formats. While much of the buzz around the Falcons centered on QBs Kirk Cousins and Michael Penix Jr., Bijan’s dominance on the ground — 1,456 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns — flew under the radar. Most notably, his rushing workload jumped from 214 carries to 304 this year. However, his receiving production was far less impressive. He totaled 431 receiving yards and one touchdown through the air. However, with Penix under center late in the season, his involvement in the passing game dipped significantly. Over the final three games, despite seeing 12 targets, he managed just 20 receiving yards. This raises concerns about his role as a receiver moving forward, putting even more emphasis on how heavily Atlanta will lean on him in the run game. Eagles RB Saquon Barkley 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 1,499.5 Rush Yards, 11.5 Rush TDs, 1.5 Rec TDs PrizePicks has Saquon Barkley's at 1.5 receiving TDs following a year where he finished with three — well, technically two. Who could forget his wide-open drop in Week 2 against the Falcons, an uncharacteristic miscue from the usually sure-handed back? Barkley had a chance to break the single-season rushing record against his former team, the Giants, in Week 18, but the Eagles opted to sit him after his incredible 2,005-yard campaign. Fortunately for him, Philadelphia’s offensive line remains largely intact. According to Fox Sports, OT Lane Johnson confirmed before the Super Bowl that he isn’t retiring, meaning Barkley will continue to benefit from one of the league’s best blocking units. While defenses may key in more on the run next season, Jalen Hurts’ Super Bowl performance proved he can beat teams through the air. The Chiefs contained Barkley for the most part, yet the Eagles still dominated, showcasing just how well-rounded this offense is. With that balance, Barkley should have no trouble continuing to put up big numbers in 2025.

Giants WR Malik Nabers 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 1,174.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 Rec TDs With 1,204 receiving yards in his rookie season — despite missing two midseason games — Giants WR Malik Nabers made the most of his opportunities, accounting for 34.2% of the Giants’ total receiving yards. The 2025 NFL Draft presents a prime opportunity for New York to address its quarterback situation, and they may also explore veteran QB options in free agency. After ranking 28th in passing yards per game (189.9), it's hard to imagine a scenario where a new quarterback doesn’t provide a boost for Nabers in 2025. His dominance at LSU in 2023 — 1,569 yards, 14 touchdowns, and a 34.9% target share — justified his selection at No. 6 overall in last year’s draft. Given his proven ability to command targets and produce at a high level, the 1,174.5-yard projection set for his 2025 season looks attainable, so long as the Giants can bring in help for Nabers as QB. Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr. 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 1,124.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 Rec TDs Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr. was the biggest surprise at wide receiver in the 2024 season, finishing as the WR4 in PPR leagues. Coming into the NFL, there were mixed opinions on his potential, as he played behind Malik Nabers at LSU and commanded just a 21.9% target share — though he made up for it with an elite 17 touchdown season. Despite the uncertainty, Thomas thrived as a rookie, racking up 1,282 yards and 10 touchdowns. What makes his breakout even more impressive is that he produced those numbers with Trevor Lawrence in a down year and injured, and Mac Jones getting seven starts under center with zero 300-yard passing games and only one game over 250 yards. Given Thomas’ strong debut, what’s the case for regression? If anything, he’s proven he can be a top-tier option regardless of quarterback play. With his 2025 season receiving yards projection set at 1,124.5 receiving yards and 7.5 touchdowns, he can achieve both with even a repeat performance of his rookie year. More 2025 Fantasy Football WR Projections Here are more 2025 fantasy football WR projections via NFLSZN on PrizePicks. - Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase: 1,349.5 Receiving Yards, 10.5 TDs - Vikings WR Justin Jefferson: 1,374.5 Receiving Yards, 8.5 TDs - Rams WR Puka Nacua: 1,324.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 TDs - Buccaneers WR Mike Evans: 1,049.5 Receiving Yards, 9.5 TDs - Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb: 1,274.5 Receiving Yards. 8.5 TDs - Texans WR Nico Collins: 1,199.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 TDs - Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown: 1,199.5 Receiving Yards, 8.5 TDs - Eagles WR A.J. Brown: 1,124.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 TDs - Falcons WR Drake London: 1,074.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 Rec TDs - Chargers WR Ladd McConkey: 1,074.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 Rec TDs - Commanders WR Terry McLaurin: 1,024.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 Rec TDs - Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba: 1,024.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 Rec TDs - Eagles WR DeVonta Smith: 999.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 Rec TDs - Seahawks WR D.K. Metcalf: 999.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 Rec TDs - Bears WR D.J. Moore: 999.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 Rec TDs 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: Tight Ends Here are some of the top 2025 fantasy football projections from tight ends, via the NFLSZN board on PrizePicks — the NFL season-long real money game. Lions TE Sam LaPorta 2025 Fantasy Football Projections: 774.5 Receiving Yards, 7.5 TDs Lions TE Sam LaPorta had a slow start to the 2024 fantasy football season, averaging just 7.1 PPG through the first seven weeks. However, he turned things around in the second half, averaging 13.2 PPG and finishing the season with 726 receiving yards. While that marked a decline from his impressive rookie campaign of 889 yards, it’s far from a reason to panic. LaPorta’s late-season surge, highlighted by 8.5 targets per game over the final six weeks, suggests the Lions won’t take as long to get him involved next year. Unlike Falcons TE Kyle Pitts — who saw a dramatic sophomore slump in 2022 under Arthur Smith’s run-heavy offense with Marcus Mariota and Desmond Ridder at quarterback — LaPorta benefits from a much better situation and offensive scheme. Lions coach Dan Campbell has shown a clear commitment to utilizing his star tight end, even designing trick plays to get him the ball. Plus, with Jared Goff at quarterback and a dominant rushing duo in Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery (who helped Detroit rank third in rushing yards per game at 149.4 rush yards per game), the Lions’ offense remains balanced and explosive. The Lions ranked third in EPA per play over during the regular season, and led the league in dropback success rate (53.6%), showing their ability to move the ball through the air at will. Despite ranking just 25th in pass-play percentage last season, Detroit still finished second in passing yards per game (266.3 yards), highlighting the efficiency of their aerial attack. More 2025 Fantasy Football TE Projections Here are more 2025 fantasy football TE projections via NFLSZN on PrizePicks. - Raiders TE Brock Bowers: 1,099.5 Receiving Yards, 5.5 TDs - Cardinals TE Trey McBride: 874.5 Receiving Yards, 4.5 TDs - Chiefs TE Travis Kelce: 774.5 Receiving Yards, 5 TDs - Ravens TE Mark Andrews: 624.5 Receiving Yards, 6.5 TDs Create Your 2025 NFLSZN Lineup on PrizePicks These early 2025 fantasy football projections are a starting point for this season — not a guarantee.

14 Must-Have Fantasy Football Draft Picks (2025),"When I jump into any fantasy football draft, these players are going to be the first to hit my queue. Each category represents a few different targets depending on where I am in the drafting process, but these are my must-have players. 2025 Must-Have Fantasy Football Players Quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen own the top two tiers, however you want to order them, but in terms of return value, there is a tier of five. One of the reasons I love Burrow so much is that he lives at the end of this tier, with around 20-25 picks lower than the top two options. Burrow finished as the fantasy QB3 after leading the league in attempts, yards and passing touchdowns. The thing that does stand out is that it took him to be the leader in those big categories, and he still finished only third. That isn’t lost on me. What stays with me is that you get volume, and lots of it. The Bengals’ defense isn’t going to hold many back, which should lead to more offensive opportunities. The combo of Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins returning should lead to a huge floor for his passing yards. Rushing quarterbacks are still king, but you could put yourself in the position to draft more position players early. The late-round quarterback route is where I’ll go if I miss on Burrow, but the consistency you get while drafting three or four position players prior is weighted in fantasy gold. Justin Fields isn’t flashy in the traditional fantasy quarterback sense. The idea of drafting Fields as your starting quarterback can be a bit foreign, but it really shouldn’t be. Over his six starts, he scored five rushing touchdowns, recorded three 50-yard rushing games and passed 24+ times in four out of the six starts. This was in Pittsburgh. Going to the Jets, I like the offensive line better and the running backs with what they can do out of the backfield, plus Garrett Wilson‘s ability to get open with the right combo of wide receivers. Josh Reynolds‘ ability to play more short yardage and Allen Lazard‘s ability to stretch the field are also pluses. The supporting cast suits him well. Over those six weeks with the Steelers, despite some of the ugliness, he was still QB6 in fantasy. Fields’ FantasyPros expert consensus ranking (ECR) has risen from the teens to 10 from June to July, but in a majority of drafting spots, you’re going to see him available around the 12th quarterback. Here is what I love the most about late-round quarterback targets: you get one high upside signal-caller, like Fields, and then pair him with safe floor play like Jared Goff or Brock Purdy. Fields might be one of the best upside quarterbacks in fantasy that isn’t going in the top eight of drafts. Running Backs If you broke up the season into three pieces (Weeks 1-6, Weeks 7-12 and Weeks 13-18), Jahmyr Gibbs was never not an RB1 in points per game (PPG) in half-PPR. Take a look at his results in these buckets: - Weeks 1-6: RB10 - Weeks 7-12: RB3 - Weeks 13-18: RB2 This is just a story of consistency for a running back that explosive and built around upside. He did this despite David Montgomery sharing the backfield (Montgomery missed Weeks 16-18). Gibbs had the highest expected points added (EPA) among starters per carry, had the top breakout rate among all starters, according to PlayerProfiler and was the second best in true yards per carry (YPC) at 5.21. If David Montgomery wasn’t in the picture, I’d be comfortable with Gibbs as the top running back in the land. Despite Montgomery being there, Gibbs is still one of my favorite early draft targets when people are taking Saquon Barkley ahead of him. Anyone who knows me probably isn’t surprised that Christian McCaffrey is on this list. He is indeed an injury risk. The Niners were weird about giving out all the info, and it backfired. Running backs not named Derrick Henry don’t tend to age well, so there is a ton of injury risk. The counter is that he is a monster in this offense, and the 49ers won’t take their foot off the McCaffrey gas as long as he’s standing. We are a year removed from McCaffrey ripping off 2,000+ total yards and 21 touchdowns. Due to this risk, he is now going in the second round as the RB7. With the departure of Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk‘s injury, he’ll be counted on in the passing game as much as in the running game. Even if he takes a few plays off mid-series to preserve health, which could be an argument against him, he will dominate the red zone. That is without question. Figure out what you can stomach at running back, and if you can sprinkle in a little risk, McCaffrey could return as the No. 1 RB in fantasy in the second round. Chubba Hubbard finished 2024 as the fantasy RB13 in half-PPR. He put up almost 1,400 yards in 15 games played. Every game he received 20 carries, he was a top-10 fantasy running back. In seven games last season, he had 20+ touches in a game, finishing as a top-12 fantasy running back in six of them. The Rico Dowdle signing doesn’t do much to scare me off. It’s a cheap one-year deal. Dowdle is insurance, not there to take away. The Panthers found some rhythm at the end of the year, and I think that makes them sneaky. Hubbard is RB17 in the ranks, but RB19 in average draft position (ADP). He has RB1 upside and should be drafted everywhere. There is a big clump of rookie running backs that make up the 20 range of fantasy running backs, with Kaleb Johnson being the cheapest of the group, according to FantasyPros ranks at RB29. You can argue that Jaylen Warren could take on a bigger role now that Najee Harris is gone, but I don’t think the team wants that. I think they want to run it back how they did last year, and that’s why Johnson has a great shot to walk into significant touches. Johnson graded out high in Pro Football Focus’ (PFF) elusive rating, yet he may be used more as a north and south runner, which will work well in Arthur Smith’s offense. They won’t be afraid to throw to him in the open field with some of that elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability either. His ADP is what makes him so intriguing, with the lowest cost, in a run-heavy offense, making him a must-draft RB3 for your fantasy team. Master your draft with the latest rankings, sleepers, and strategy tips in our Best Ball Draft Kit. Wide Receivers If I can pair one of the top wide receivers with Ladd McConkey to start my draft, I’m doing it. He had the 11th-best receiving grade via PFF of wideouts with 100+ targets. Among wideouts who played qualified snaps, McConkey ranked fourth overall with 2.59 yards per route run. McConkey’s ability out of the slot to haul in targets, get yards after the catch and even put up an over 10 average depth of target (aDOT) looks to me like a Puka Nacua-lite. Some can argue that maybe his rookie year was the peak, but this team will want the ball in his hands, and they will find it across the middle at will. McConkey could walk out of 2025 as a top-five wide receiver in fantasy. Tet is going to be a matchup problem for cornerbacks for years to come. He’s 6’5, a great route runner, can play outside and in, and has a college track record of massive volume. He’s a wideout who is going to make the big play, but will the big plays come in Carolina is the real question. Bryce Young made some big strides towards the end of the year. He was the second overall QB in fantasy the final three weeks of the season. He found his rhythm and got the ball in the air. Now, McMillan will become his top target. In a world of fantasy where rookies get hyped beyond belief, it seems as though he is coming at a discount, outside the top-24 wideouts. Marvin burned us last year, but would that burn have been as impactful if he wasn’t going in the first or second round? It works out beautifully as well, so you can take him as a WR3 in most cases, who can then be paired shortly after with another vet. McMillan will be on many of my teams. What a messy year it was for Dolphins receivers. Year-over-year, Jaylen Waddle lost about a full yard per route run, which is a huge number. Part of this was the offense moving into more run plays versus how they used to stretch the field. The other culprit could have been Jonnu Smith, who is now gone. I’m not worried about Darren Waller, nor should you, and that should lead to Waddle being a force across the middle of the field again. He’s going off as the WR33, with top-20 wideout potential if the ball gets back in the air. There are a lot of mouths to feed in San Francisco, but I believe Jauan Jennings is still the most underrated, even after starting his breakout last year. Deebo Samuel is gone and Brandon Aiyuk’s injury leaves him up in the air. Jennings can and has played both roles in place of those wide receivers last year, and he earned Brock Purdy’s trust. Jennings played over 40% of his snaps out of the slot, which could increase with Ricky Pearsall on the outside. He averaged 2.24 yards per route run, which ranked 16th among wideouts, and an over 10 aDOT. I believe Jennings can be the No. 1 WR in this offense. Touchdowns will be key for him to become a top-20 wideout in fantasy or be a comfortable WR3 for your fantasy team. He’s one of the better values to invest in the Niners’ offense. Josh Downs is a pretty popular breakout for many. The reason is his dominance out of the slot and ability to stretch it into more. Had he not missed a few games, we could easily be looking at him with 80+ catches and 1,000+ yards. He ranks high in the yards per route department and tops among Colts receivers. Daniel Jones at quarterback might not be a bad thing for Downs, being a checkdown option. If Anthony Richardson comes back healthy and takes the next step, Downs could be a Jaxon Smith-Njigba-lite. His ADP is too good not to invest in. Coming into his second year, Keon Coleman is a great breakout target. He proved to be a big play target; we just needed more consistency and offensive targets. He averaged over 19 yards per catch, and even without serious target volume, could be this year’s Jameson Williams. When you get to the 40 range of wideouts, you should look to take a shot or two on high-ceiling players, and Coleman has the potential to take the top wideout spot in Buffalo this year. Tight Ends Travis Kelce has lost a step, but the pricing just seems off for a tight end who still brought in 97 balls last year. He was the most targeted tight end in the red zone, yet put up a career low three touchdowns. Rashee Rice’s return will take focus in the red zone, which should create positive touchdown regression just based on his targets alone. We are in an elite tight end world right now, and there is a chance Kelce could pop back to being a top-three tight end, but at half the cost. If I miss on the top options, Kelce becomes a prime target instead of trying to deal with late-round options. It’s hard not to imagine Evan Engram can become a favorite target of Bo Nix very early on. Sean Payton is going to move Engram around and create opportunities. The Broncos, outside of Courtland Sutton, suffered from no other real threat. Engram can not only be that, but also a force in the red zone. Engram represents the last of the “I need to draft this guy” tight ends, with real top-five tight end upside.

20 Must-Have Players (2025 Fantasy Football),"The 2025 NFL season is approaching, and that means it’s time to prepare for your fantasy football draft. What better way to do that than to practice drafting with our free mock draft simulator? Beyond our tools, we’re also going to have you covered throughout the draft prep season with our content. One of the most important aspects of completing a successful fantasy football draft is knowing who to target. Sure, there could be “value” that presents itself through the draft, but it’s important to know which players you should not only target as values but also those you need to circle on your cheat sheets and prepare to reach for if needed, especially in the early rounds, where everybody is good. It’s all about unearthing the best of the best. Here are my top players to target in 2025 fantasy football. Be sure to pair this with my early-round draft strategy (dropping soon in the 2025 FantasyPros DraftKit) to DOMINATE your league this year. Check out the dissenting opinions tool to see how my ranks stack up against ECR, ADP, and other fantasy football analysts at FantasyPros! Andrew Erickson’s Fantasy Football Draft Targets Quarterbacks In 2023, Justin Fields averaged nearly 22 points per game from Week 4 onward. In his six starts during the 2024 season, Fields was the QB6 overall and QB7 in points per game (19.1). He was fourth in fantasy points per dropback (0.62). Fields rushed for at least 27 rushing yards in five of his six starts (surpassing 50 rushing yards three times). The Jets’ new QB1 has similar fantasy upside to the elite QB Tier with his rushing ability. One that new head coach Aaron Glenn is all too familiar with during his tenure in Detroit as the defensive coordinator. Fields faced the Lions five times during his time with the Bears, rushing for 100+ yards in three of those contests. The Jets’ new head coach has already expressed a desire to utilize Fields’ legs, which should be of interest to fantasy football drafters. The passing is not nearly good enough compared to the S Tier QBs, but having his former Ohio State teammate in Garrett Wilson might help him take another step as a passer. The Jets have also added to their offense via the NFL Draft with offensive tackle Armand Membou and tight end Mason Taylor. Both players are expected to make immediate impacts as offensive starters. I’d also say Fields’ job security as the starter is relatively safe. They didn’t select a quarterback in the NFL Draft, and Tyrod Taylor is the backup. There will be no pressure to put Taylor in as the starter unless Fields is stringing together weeks of poor performances. Fields is currently being drafted as the QB12 in early best ball ADP. Drake Maye sits firmly entrenched in my top 12 fantasy quarterback rankings this season. The offensive environment in New England has only improved for Maye with offensive additions in NFL free agency and the 2025 NFL Draft. The Pats drafted offensive tackle Will Campbell, running back TreVeyon Henderson, wide receiver Kyle Williams, and center Jared Wilson. In free agency, they acquired wide receiver Stefon Diggs, offensive tackle Morgan Moses, and center Garrett Bradbury. They needed to bolster the offensive line and add explosiveness for their second-year QB. They achieved both. And don’t sleep on offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. As a head coach? Terrible. As an OC? You have my attention. He’s had past success with non-GOAT QBs: Mac Jones (rookie QB) and Cam Newton (mobile QB). And fantasy gamers can’t afford to ignore Maye’s dual-threat skill set. The Patriots QB HAS the cheat code. Last season, he ranked 5th in QB scramble efficiency (@PattonAnalytics) behind only the 4 starting QBs who played in the conference championship games. Among the seven passers in 2024 that recorded 30+ rushing yards per game (including Maye), five finished inside the top six scoring signal-callers on a per-dropback basis. What Maye was able to achieve as a rookie in a terrible situation cannot be understated. According to @NextGenStats, Maye was 1 of just 2 QBs to post positive EPA on tight window throws (The other was Lamar Jackson). He threw at least one touchdown pass in the 10 games he played fully as a rookie (finished on a streak of eight games overall as a rookie – the longest streak by a rookie since Justin Herbert in 2020. That resulted in 18.1 fantasy points per game, which would have ranked QB15 on the year. Maye’s current draft position is QB16, according to our consensus best ball ADP. He is the perfect late-round QB to draft. He is the archetype of a quarterback who makes the leap and wins leagues. Running Backs Over three seasons at Boise State, Ashton Jeanty rushed for 4,760 yards on 748 carries (6.4 YPA) with 50 touchdowns. The 5-foot-9 and 211-pound RB had just 10 fumbles on 748 carries (1.3% rate) and displayed steady year-over-year growth, particularly excelling as a receiver in his second season. According to Football Insights, Jeanty finished his collegiate career with the highest missed tackle forced per touch rate (39%). His career dominator rating ranks inside the top five. His yards per play (3.4) mark is also elite. His dominance as a junior, with a 43% dominator rating while rushing for an eye-popping 2,595 yards (6.9 YPA) and 29 touchdowns, puts him in elite company. The Las Vegas Raiders selected him 6th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft. In the desert, Jeanty is going to see all the volume he can handle. He will get all the touches he needs to score fantasy points. Also, during Chip Kelly’s four years as an NFL offensive coordinator, in three of those seasons, his backfields had a 16.6-17.7% target share, but he also flooded his Philly backfield with targets in 2015 (28.7%) per Derek Brown. Jeanty’s average draft position (ADP) in 2025 will likely be late in the first round based on his best ball ADP. But based on the proposition of talent/opportunity, it’s not a bad bet to make on the uber-talented rookie running back from Boise State. Historically speaking, the odds are in his favor to return on his late-round 1 ADP. The last two rookie RBs drafted highly in the first round two years ago – Bijan Robinson (8th) and Jahmyr Gibbs (12th) – finished as top 10 fantasy RBs in Year 1 (9th and 10th, respectively). The high-end rookies entering with top-tier draft capital post top-5 numbers during some pocket of games in Year 1. Tough to completely pass on in best ball with the contest structures heavily weighted from Weeks 15-17. And for redraft purposes, there are plenty of RB values that you can pair with Jeanty to help mitigate any slow start as he gets accustomed to the pros. We made it, fam. Chase Brown SZN is full-go. The Bengals’ lone addition during the 2025 NFL Draft was Texas Tech back Tahj Brooks, whom they selected in the sixth round. Zack Moss is still on the roster, but he is coming off a season-ending neck injury. Cincinnati brought running back Samaje Perine back after his one-year stint with the Chiefs. Ergo, the Bengals feel comfortable rolling with Brown and Perine as a one-two punch with Brooks providing a reliable depth option. That means Brown’s fantasy ceiling and elite role (or at least close to elite) is firmly back on his 2025 projection. His role last year was elite. Similarly to how the Rams have deployed Kyren Williams, Zac Taylor’s coaching staff has shown a willingness to deploy one back who plays almost all the snaps. Taylor said in a June 12th presser that Brown is making it a priority for the offensive coaches to get him the ball, despite the embarrassment of riches they have among their offensive skill group. After Moss went down in 2024, Brown took over the Cincinnati backfield in Week 9. He had an eight-game streak of 90+ yards from scrimmage. Brown was the RB5 in points per game (18.4) and the RB1 in expected points per game (22.3). The Bengals’ emerging star was Pro Football Focus’ (PFF) 14th-highest graded rusher and unquestioned bell-cow back, exactly like his final season at Illinois. With an elite receiving role to boot, Brown projects like a more explosive Kyren Williams in 2025. Brown ranks in the top 10 in my 2025 running back rankings and is the RB13 in early best ball ADP. James Conner continues to be one of the most underappreciated and bankable fantasy running backs in the NFL – and 2025 might be his best value yet. Despite entering his age-30 season, Conner showed no signs of decline in 2024. He finished as the RB11 overall and RB14 in fantasy points per game (matching Kenneth Walker per game pace) while playing 13-plus games for the first time since 2021. His 283 touches translated into 1,508 total yards and nine touchdowns, reaffirming his bell-cow status in an improving Arizona offense. What makes Conner’s case even stronger is how efficient he was, not just productive. From Weeks 10-18, he was one of PFF’s top-graded RBs, joining elite company like Bijan Robinson, Derrick Henry, and Josh Jacobs. According to Fantasy Points Data, in 2024 he ranked: - 2nd in missed tackles forced per attempt - 11th in yards after contact per attempt - 6th in explosive run rate - 6th in yards per route run - 7th in receiving yards per game Over the past two seasons, Conner ranks 10th among all RBs in total yards from scrimmage, sixth in rushing yards per game, and eighth in scrimmage yards per game (93.5) – the RBs ahead of him are all being drafted well ahead (minimum 24 games played) inside the 20 overall RBs. Given the ease of the opening schedule, I expect Conner to be very productive out of the gate for the Red Birds. Ride him till the wheels fall off. Ready to build a dynasty?

Get the edge and set your team up for long-term success. Etienne was a borderline disaster in 2024. He carried over his sluggish finish in 2023 losing work to Tank Bigsby playing in a bad offense heralded by a backup quarterback for the majority of the season. He was a flat-out bust after being a star in 2023. Although to be fair, Etienne still had a higher rushing success rate than Bigbsy, who flashed more as a boom-or-bust rusher. Etienne also battled through several different injuries. But Trevor Lawrence will be back and healthy for 2024, and the Jaguars have hired former Buccaneers OC Liam Coen as their head coach to bring this offense back to expectations. There will be no allegiance to either Etienne or Bigsby as the team’s starting RB and the new coaching staff could easily deploy a committee in a similar fashion to last season. In his opening presser, Coen stated that the Jaguars had two running backs who they could do many good things with. They also drafted two RBs in this year’s draft (albeit on Day 3). But in totality, this running game is going to improve dramatically. Coen’s rushing attacks have been prolific at each stop, coming from the Sean McVay-style run game. This guy got Rachaad White over 4 yards per carry. Wizardry. Even if the 26-year-old doesn’t get back to top 3 RB status, his one-down season hardly warrants such a drastically low ADP in a situation that looks favorable for his outlook in 2025. And so far, early offseason reports suggest he is going to stay in DUVAL county despite all the offseason trade rumors swirling around the Jaguars’ backfield. He’s done everything the new coaching staff has asked of him, and his connection with starting QB dates back to their time spent at Clemson together. It’s too early to write off Etienne entirely after an injury-riddled 2024 season, with him going outside the top 100 in back-end RB3 territory in early best ball drafts. Bigsby and Tuten still need to prove themselves to this new coaching staff as well, given their ball security issues. I love Tuten as a rookie sleeper (keep reading), but I can acknowledge it’s not his backfield from the jump. And if ETN gets traded to the Bears, Cowboys or some other RB-needy team, that might also be a WIN for his fantasy value. We love targeting ambiguous backfields for upside. That is Jacksonville’s backfield. If Etienne wins the starting job, he has easy top-15 upside in this Coen offense. Etienne has an RB3 and RB17 finish on his resume after falling off in 2024 (RB36). The Minnesota Vikings traded for Jordan Mason this offseason, and he is one Aaron Jones injury away from a full workload. The Vikings didn’t draft any backs in this year’s draft, and Ty Chandler fell out of favor on the depth chart last season. This is going to be a two-headed monster in Minnesota behind a revamped interior offensive line that has done nothing but upgrade with the acquisitions of Ryan Kelly, Will Fries, and Donovan Jackson. In addition to finishing fourth in yards over expected per attempt and seventh in rushing yards after contact last season, Mason ranked second in total rushing yards (667) before his injury in Week 8. I fully expect Mason to take on a larger role near the goal line, given that Jones struggled immensely in this area in 2024 (-14.4 EPA generated in goal-to-goal situations last season). We should see more rushing TDs from this Vikings offense after last season’s disaster at the goal line. Jones/Mason combined for 22 goal-line carries, but they scored just five TDs. 76 red-zone touches (Jones + Mason) resulted in seven TDs. The 2024 Vikings ranked 30th in carries per rushing TD (54.3). Only PIT and DAL were worse. That’s due to change. Entering last year, GB was last in carries per TD. Josh Jacobs had 15 rushing TDs in 2024. Positive regression hits hard, especially behind an improving OL. Draft Jordan Mason as RB36? Yes. The former Virginia Tech RB was selected at the top of the 4th round by Jacksonville, and is shaping up to be Liam Coen’s new Bucky Irving in Duval County. As previously stated, the new coaching staff has no allegiance to either Etienne or Bigsby, putting Tuten in a position to dramatically out-produce his draft capital. Tuten was a dominant producer at the college level with a career 30% dominator rating, highlighted by a 37% dominator rating last season (despite battling through an ankle injury). He finished the 2024 season top 10 in the FBS in yards after contact per attempt (4.4) among RBs with at least 100 carries. Also ranked 6th in the 2025 RB draft class in yards after contact per attempt and breakaway run percentage (54%). According to Sports Info Solutions, Tuten finished 1st in the class in broken tackle rate per 100 dropbacks. In 2023, Irving ranked third in that same statistic. The recent reports from OTAs haven’t been glowing for Tuten, but experienced fantasy games know this is the ebbs and flows of rookies. Everybody loses their minds drafting immediately after the NFL Draft, just for their prices to come down when reality settles in that there are still unproven players that have to earn their opportunities (especially Day 3 picks). The Jets want to run the football in 2025 with a stable of RBs. And that means we could see a lot of second-year RB, Braelon Allen. Allen earned a role as an extremely young rookie last season (20 years old), despite Breece Hall being healthy to start the season. Allen is a no-nonsense rusher and could very much be the “David Montgomery” in the Jets’ offense under new OC Tanner Engstrand (formerly of the Lions). Allen converted on 11 of his 12 carries on 3rd-1 last year, a 91.7% rate that was not only the best among all NFL backs in 2024 but the best by any back from 2021-24 (Jets.com). Expect with Justin Fields under center for Allen to take full advantage of wide-open rushing lanes. Wide Receivers Buy high on Drake London, who is a dark horse to be the No. 1 WR overall in fantasy football in 2025. We know the WR1 overall typically leads the NFL in red-zone targets, and that has been London’s calling card. The 25-year-old WR ended 2024 with 23 red-zone targets, tied for the third-most among all WRs (fifth in red-zone targets per game). The Falcons’ WR ranks first in red zone target rate over the past three seasons. He also operated from the slot more last season. London was one of the highest-graded WRs operating from the slot, third only to elite WRs: Puka Nacua and Nico Collins (PFF). He was also a target hog, with the third-highest target rate per route run (30%). London was targeted on 41% of his routes with Michael Penix Jr. under center. Red-zone targets have been one of the biggest predictors of high-end fantasy seasons at the position. His ADP is too low for the WR5 in total points through 18 games last season. After two years of hype, Jameson Williams finally delivered the breakout we’d all been waiting for. In 2024, the former 12th overall pick in the 2022 draft finished as the WR19 in total points and WR20 in points per game, posting 1,000+ receiving yards and 7 touchdowns across 15 games. He did so on just 59 receptions and 92 targets, showcasing elite efficiency and explosive playmaking ability, including ranking third in the NFL in yards after catch per reception. Williams truly turned it on down the stretch. After returning from suspension in Week 10, he was the WR10 in fantasy points per game (nearly 14) while commanding a 21% target share – almost identical to Amon-Ra St. Brown‘s target rate from Weeks 12-18 (excluding ARSB’s monster 18-target outlier in Week 15). Williams recorded 5+ receptions in six of his last eight games and hit at least 7 targets in every regular-season contest over that span. His late-season surge included three top 6 weekly finishes, a feat only 10 other WRs matched in 2024. He capped the year with a 61-yard rushing touchdown in the playoffs, further highlighting his dynamic skill set and game-breaking speed. Jamo is a big play waiting to happen. He has scored 9 of his 15 career TDs on plays over 40 yards (11 over 30-plus yards). All gas, no brakes. The arrival of new offensive coordinator John Morton, who already declared 2025 as a “breakout year” for Williams, might be exactly what Jamo needs to go to the next level. HC Dan Campbell is already onboard, stating that “the sky’s the limit” for Williams in 2025. If the Lions shift away from their slot Sun God-centric approach after Ben Johnson’s departure and diversify their passing game, Jamo could ascend to WR1 territory in fantasy formats. Given the recent news of Amon-Ra St. Brown undergoing off-season clean-up knee surgery, it’s just more fuel to the fire for Williams to play a bigger role in the Lions’ 2025 offense that could look a little different under a new play caller. Tetairoa McMillan lands in an ideal situation to emerge as the alpha wideout in Carolina. Drafted with top-10 capital (8th overall) the former Arizona star joins a Panthers offense in need of a true WR1. McMillan brings size, production and opportunity to a WR room featuring an underwhelming Xavier Legette and a promising but undrafted Jalen Coker. T-Mac was just one of 3 WRs in the FBS in 2023 to hit 1,396 yards, 10 TDs, and 89 receptions. The others being fellow top-10 WR draft selections: Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze. If Bryce Young takes even a modest step forward and continues to fuel fantasy success for his No. 1 target, McMillan could be this year’s breakout rookie receiver. Note that Adam Thielen surpassed both 100 catches and 1,000 receiving yards during Young’s rookie season. Last year in Dave Canales’ offense, the Panthers’ No. 1 WR between Diontae Johnson/Thielen was pacing for over 1,100 receiving yards over a 17-game sample size (33% first-read target share). In Thielen’s last six games, he averaged 14.6 fantasy points per game – a mark that would have ranked 8th among all WRs last season. I just can’t quit Jaylen Waddle. Even after he averaged barely nine points per game with Tua Tagovailoa last season and finished as the WR46 in half-PPR (WR56 in points per game). Waddle took a backseat in the Miami offense with Jonnu Smith and De’Von Achane vacuuming up the underneath targets. The games Tagovailoa missed further cratered Waddle’s numbers. It was bad. Even so, Waddle had just as many 100-yard games with Tagovailoa as Tyreek Hill (two), although he averaged nearly three more yards per target (8.0 vs 11.0). Waddle is also just 26 years old, and part of his down year was related to a lack of touchdowns. He scored six touchdowns in the last two seasons, compared to 14 in his first two years in the NFL. Given how the Miami Dolphins’ season ended, I can’t imagine they run back the same offense they deployed in 2024. If Hill continues his downward trajectory or Miami moves on, Waddle will benefit greatly. We saw glimpses of his upside at the end of the year. And the team just traded away Jonnu Smith to the Pittsburgh Steelers. In three of Waddle’s last four full games in 2024, he commanded nine or more targets, going over 99 receiving yards twice and averaged over 13 fantasy points per game. Despite the two down years, Waddle ranks in the top 15 in receiving yards through his first four seasons (3 seasons of at least 1,000 yards). I’ll take my chances with Waddle as a fantasy WR3 banking on a bounce back. Calvin Ridley quietly delivered solid fantasy football value in 2024, finishing with over 1,000 yards for the second straight season while leading the NFL in team air yard share (48%). While he only finished as the WR26 in total points and WR40 in points per game, he did outperform his WR35 ADP. Ridley’s late-season surge – 11.6 points per game (WR26) after DeAndre Hopkins was traded, essentially doubling his fantasy points per game – showed what he can do as the undisputed top option. With Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and his nine touchdowns gone, and first-overall pick Cam Ward now under center, Ridley could thrive as the clear No. 1 WR in a Brian Callahan-led offense. According to 4for4’s Justin Edwards, the Titans rank top-five in vacated targets to receivers and first to receiver targets inside the 10-yard line. If Ward is even average, Ridley’s elite usage profile makes him a strong bet to exceed his WR34 ADP. The Titans’ No. 1 WR could be a huge success in fantasy football, given his finish as the WR29 in expected points per game and WR17 in total expected fantasy points in 2024. Keep in mind that Ridley has never finished worse than WR26 in any healthy season he has played during his NFL career. Rome Odunze is a potential second-year breakout candidate hiding in plain sight. The former top-10 pick had a poor rookie season statistically – WR49 overall and WR66 in points per game – but the circumstances around him were far from ideal. Odunze dealt with a lingering MCL sprain early in the season, played in a broken Chicago offense led by an ineffective OC (Shane Waldron), and still managed to lead the Bears in high-value touches (air yards/red-zone targets) over the second half of the season. He ranked 10th in end-zone targets (14) and had 17 red-zone looks, but caught just 6 – a clear case for positive touchdown regression. Despite the dysfunction, Odunze flashed big-play/downfield upside with a 13.9 average depth of target (6th) and deep target rate. He outproduced Keenan Allen in air yards and red-zone usage and saw more valuable targets than D.J. Moore despite a lower overall target share. Now, in 2025, there are reasons to be optimistic. New HC Ben Johnson steps in after building a top-tier offense in Detroit. Veteran Keenan Allen is gone, opening up over 100 targets. The offensive line has been upgraded in free agency. Caleb Williams enters Year 2, with Odunze positioned to become his go-to target. And perhaps most importantly, Odunze is finally healthy. If Odunze earns more slot reps (where Johnson has historically funneled volume), he’s a screaming value at his current ADP. D.J. Moore was locked into a low-aDOT role (5.3) in the final eight games last year, which could make Odunze the Bears’ vertical and red-zone specialist – a high-value fantasy role on the field. Odunze has a WR3 floor with WR1 breakout upside. At worst, he can be a fantasy WR3 that Allen was last season for the Bears. Don’t be surprised if he emerges as Williams’ true No. 1 option as early as this season. We saw a glimpse of Odunze’s ceiling in a game that Allen missed in 2024 (Week 3 versus the Colts), going for 112 yards and one TD on 11 targets. All season highs. Keep in mind that the newcomers from this year’s draft (Colston Loveland and Luther Burden) have missed time during OTAs with injuries. Loveland is rehabbing his shoulder injury from college and Burden is dealing with a soft tissue injury. Marvin Mims flashed major upside in the second half of 2024, averaging 62 receiving yards per game and leading all WRs in yards per route run (3.63) from Week 11 onward. He also posted a strong 28% target rate per route run on the year, ranking 13th in the NFL. Still just 23 years old, Mims is a prime third-year breakout candidate in a Broncos offense looking to grow alongside Bo Nix. Tight Ends While injuries limited him to nine games last year (TE16 in points per game), Evan Engram still averaged over five catches per contest – classic PPR production. Engram has a history of strong Year 1 impacts with new teams (TE6 in first seasons with both the Giants and Jaguars). He now steps into a likely high-volume role in Denver with no established receivers behind Courtland Sutton. If he stays healthy, a return to top-five fantasy tight end status is well within reach in Sean Payton’s offense. In 2023, Engram posted a career-best 114 receptions for 963 yards and 4 touchdowns, proving to be a high-volume target in Jacksonville’s offense as the TE4 in fantasy points per game. He’s ready to embrace the Joker role in the Broncos offense. WHY SO SERIOUS? Another year, and another tale of two seasons for the Browns tight end. David Njoku finished 5th in fantasy points per game (10.6) and TE11 overall in 11 games played. The Browns TE missed three games to start the year and was placed on season-ending IR after Week 16. The 29-year-old TE was at his best with Jameis Winston under center, averaging north of 12 points per game (12.1). Equivalent to Brock Bowers. But for the second straight season, Njoku might have another new QB that wasn’t part of his hot streak the year before. At worst, Njoku’s ability to perform with different QBs the past two seasons is encouraging that he won’t completely fall off in 2025, regardless of who is throwing him passes. Let’s not forget the heater Njoku went on with Joe Flacco back in 2023 (five games): 15.4 fantasy points per game, 22% target share (9 targets per game) and a 29% target rate per route run. I’d also expect Njoku to remain a staple in the offense under new OC Tommy Rees, who served as the pass game specialist & tight ends coach for the Browns last season. Njoku finished third in expected points, third in targets per game (8.5) and second in end-zone targets (11) among TEs. The Browns tight end should easily see 100-plus targets in this offense so I am having trouble wrapping my mind around his TE10 price tag outside the top-100 picks. Once we get Flacco as the starter (my best guess to start the year), his ADP is going to surge. He is TE8 in the projections, but he is in the second tier, which is separated by five points. In 2024, Kraft led all tight ends in yards after the catch per reception (8.8) with an eye-popping 15 missed tackles. Second only to George Kittle in 20+ yard catch rate (22%). GB’s tight end ran away with the starting job over Luke Musgrave and never looked back, finishing as the TE8 overall and 10th in points per game (8.3). The Packers passing game never fully got unlocked with Jordan Love constantly banged up, but this receiving corps is wide open for somebody to step up. A roster filled with beta WRs looking for an alpha to emerge especially with Christian Watson suffering a torn ACL injury late in the year. Kraft has a real shot to lead this team in red-zone looks AND explosive plays after leading the team in red-zone targets with Love healthy last season (1/game). Head coach Matt LaFleur confirmed at the end of the season – that 100% – that Kraft has the potential to be a George Kittle or Travis Kelce type of player. Henry was quietly a top-12 TE in total fantasy points and expected points per game in 2024. Finished the year as the TE16 in PPG, coming off career-highs in receptions (66) and yards (674). And yet? He scored just two TDs. He tied for 5th in red-zone targets AND ranked 2nd in targets inside the 10-yard line. Positive regression, anyone? With Drake Maye under center in nine games last year: - Henry averaged 8.8 PPG - On pace for 85 catches, 850 yards If Maye makes a leap, Henry comes with him. The Patriots TE has averaged nearly 5 TDs/year since joining the Pats. He has a long history of red-zone usage, and is dirt-cheap in drafts. Let’s not forget that Henry’s best fantasy season came back in 2021 when Josh McDaniels was the Patriots’ OC.

2025 fantasy football rankings,"- Ja’Marr Chase takes the top spot: Chase was the top fantasy scorer among wide receivers in 2024, making him the safest and most reliable pick at the top of 2025 fantasy football drafts. - Bijan Robinson leads the running backs: Saquon Barkley led all running backs in fantasy points in 2024, but Bijan Robinson offered more week-to-week consistency. - Subscribe to PFF+: Get access to player grades, PFF Premium Stats, fantasy football rankings, all of the PFF fantasy draft research tools and more! With the 2025 NFL season fast approaching, it's the perfect time to prep for your fantasy football drafts using the most accurate single-quarterback, redraft PPR rankings available. Curated by Nathan Jahnke — one of the industry’s most accurate rankers and a multi-time top-five finisher in the FantasyPros Accuracy Competition — these rankings are built on current depth charts, projected roles and coaching trends to spotlight players poised for early and sustained success. Last updated: Monday, July 28 1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals Chase led all wide receivers in fantasy points and fantasy points per game last season. He’s consistently graded as a top-10 wide receiver, with his fantasy performance elevated by his environment. The Bengals made no changes to the coaching staff impacting Chase, the quarterback room, the wide receiver room or the tight end room. This puts Chase in one of the most pass-friendly environments in the NFL, catching passes from the best passer. While we should expect regression from anyone who finishes first in fantasy points, the lack of changes in Cincinnati should help minimize the regression. 2. RB Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons Bijan Robinson was a rare top-10 NFL draft pick at running back, leading to hefty expectations. He began meeting those expectations over the second half of 2024, consistently playing over 70% of the Falcons' offensive snaps and running at least 17 times in all but one game. This led to 22.4 fantasy points per game over the last nine weeks. He didn’t see as many 15-plus-yard carries as other great running backs, even though he’s got the talent and speed to have those runs. It’s possible some positive regression could greatly help his fantasy production this season. He lost Drew Dalman at center and still has an elite backup in Tyler Allgeier, so there is also some room to lose fantasy value. 3. RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Detroit Lions Gibbs was the 12th overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft and is one of just three running backs selected with a top-20 pick in the last seven drafts. His playing time has been limited the past two seasons as he splits time with David Montgomery. He’s managed to be an elite fantasy option with the most fantasy points per carry over the last two seasons of any running back. When Montgomery was injured late last season, he showed he could be the best running back in fantasy football if given enough opportunity. The Lions have a new offensive coordinator and new running back coach, which could lead to an increase in chances for Gibbs, pushing him closer to the top of the fantasy draft board. 4. WR Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings Jefferson has been the best wide receiver in the NFL since he was drafted in 2020, with a league-leading 93.6 receiving grade. He also ranks first in receiving yards per game at 96.5 and yards per route run at 2.64. He’s among the top five fantasy wide receivers in the last four seasons. No other wide receiver has accomplished that more than twice in those four years. In the previous three seasons, his fantasy points per game have been three points higher with Kirk Cousins compared to without him. That’s the difference between a top-five finish and a top-10 finish. Jefferson’s fantasy finish will depend heavily on J.J. McCarthy‘s development. 5. WR Brian Thomas Jr., Jacksonville Jaguars Brian Thomas Jr. had a strong start to his rookie season and ended it among the league’s best fantasy receivers. In his final seven games, he gained at least 13 PPR points each week and averaged 21.5 points, third behind only Ja’Marr Chase and Puka Nacua. He played at least 84% of his team’s offensive snaps in all but one of those games. The team added Travis Hunter in the draft, and he will see a decent target rate, but typically, two great wide receivers can co-exist as long as there isn’t much more competition for targets. Thomas led all wide receivers in yards per route run out of the slot with 3.12, and new offensive coordinator Liam Coen has found a lot of success with his slot receivers in the past. An increased role in the slot could lead Thomas to remain among the top wide receivers in fantasy football.",2025-07-28,https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025

7 League-Winning Fantasy Football Draft Picks: Dave's Must-Have Players (2025),"Dave's must-have players to draft for 2025 fantasy football leagues. His league-winning draft picks and players outlooks, including Jordan Love, De'Von Achane, and more. Summer is in full swing, and we have almost reached July. While many are currently enjoying the warm weather and fun activities, fantasy football players know what the start of summer means. NFL training camps will soon begin, and the start of another fantasy football season is upon us. Many gamers have already begun meticulously planning for their 2025 fantasy football draft. One of the best ways managers can do so is to identify high-upside players who should be priority draft picks. This is a great way to gain an edge over your league mates and could help you finally win your league's coveted championship trophy. To that end, there are quite a few players I have targeted across my dynasty portfolio, and I plan to invest heavily in these same players in my redraft leagues as well. Admittedly, this is an extensive list. So, for our purposes today, I’ve narrowed things down to the top seven names I am most bullish on this year. These are players you should aggressively target in your drafts, as they are capable of producing league-winning results. Make sure you’re following RotoBaller on X and check out RotoBaller.com for all your fantasy football needs. Here are my seven must-draft players for 2025 fantasy football leagues. Be sure to check all of our fantasy football rankings for 2025:- 2025 fantasy football rankings - Running back (RB) fantasy football rankings - Wide receiver (WR) fantasy football rankings - Tight end (TE) fantasy football rankings - Quarterback (QB) fantasy football rankings - Defense (D/ST) fantasy football rankings - NFL rookie fantasy football rankings - Best ball fantasy football rankings - Superflex fantasy football rankings - Dynasty fantasy football rankings Joe Burrow - QB, Cincinnati Bengals Burrow is coming off his best season as a pro in 2024. He threw for a career-high 4,918 passing yards and 43 touchdowns last year. As a result, Burrow finished 2024 as the overall QB3. BURROW TO CHASE. 41-YARD TD. 📺: #WASvsCIN on ABC 📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/DJW1LY5mdS— NFL (@NFL) September 24, 2024 With the team re-signing wide receiver Tee Higgins and tight end Mike Gesicki this offseason, Burrow will once again enter the 2025 season with a strong arsenal of weapons. Also working in his favor is the fact that Cincinnati has failed to adequately fix a defense that plagued the team in 2024. The Bengals' approach to fixing their defense can be described as questionable at best, but it means the team’s defense likely isn’t much better than last year. That's good news for Burrow's fantasy outlook as Cincinnati's offense will be forced to score a ton of points again in 2025. Burrow is a must-draft if he falls to the fifth round of fantasy drafts, and there’s nothing wrong with reaching for him a little early. I plan on doing so if necessary. He’ll be a player I heavily target in all my salary-cap drafts as well. Burrow is primed for another huge year and is a real threat to post a 5,000-yard, 50-touchdown season in 2025. De’Von Achane - RB, Miami Dolphins After averaging an absurd 7.8 yards per carry as a rookie, Achane’s efficiency took a step back in 2024. He only averaged 4.5 yards per carry last year. However, Achane received considerably more work as a sophomore and totaled 1,499 scrimmage yards and scored 12 total touchdowns. A robust 78 receptions would help him finish the season as the PPR RB5. ""Achane with an A+ effort and a touchdown by Miami!"" - Jim Nantz@MiamiDolphins are running away with this one pic.twitter.com/uCNa8kqkUk — NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 23, 2024 Despite finishing as a top-5 back, Achane’s current FFPC (Fantasy Football Players Championship) ADP (Average Draft Position) has him going in the middle of the second round of early drafts. It’s unclear why Achane is falling to the second round of drafts, but this is a mistake. DEVON ACHANE 67-YARD TD THE DOLPHINS HAVE 70 POINTS. 📺: #DENvsMIA on CBS 📱: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/UQdQ05hqXN pic.twitter.com/bZOSLxVaoa— NFL (@NFL) September 24, 2023 Perhaps there is some concern about his decline in efficiency. Many of his advanced metrics also took a step back last year compared to 2023. However, Miami’s offensive line was not good last year, and offensive line play can skew running back metrics. The Dolphins also appear committed to repeating their offensive approach from a year ago, and that gives Achane a safe floor as a pass-catcher. It's worth noting that Miami has taken steps to address its offensive line. But even if those changes don't help, we already know Achane can be a top-5 back behind a poor offensive line. What do people think will happen if the offensive line is better and Achane's efficiency bounces back? Bottom line: Achane can easily finish as a top-3 back and is live for an overall RB1 finish. This is a great chance to get a high-end RB1 in your draft at a discounted rate. Opportunities like this don’t come around often. I’ll wind up with a lot of Achane shares across all of my redraft leagues and have no problem reaching for him at the end of the first round. I’ll also happily take him as my RB1 in my salary-cap drafts as a cheaper alternative to Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs. With tight end Jonnu Smith now in Pittsburgh, Achane could see even more targets in the passing game. The fantasy football community is still not appropriately valuing Achane's upside. Don’t make this mistake in your draft. Kenneth Walker III - RB, Seattle Seahawks While his raw stats disappointed last year, Walker still posted some strong advanced metrics. Among 46 backs with 100+ carries, Walker finished: First in Missed Tackles Forced Per Attempt (MTF/ATT), per Fantasy Points Data Suite Third in PFF Elusive Rating Fifth in PFF Rushing Grade Ninth in Missed Tackles Forced (MTF), per Fantasy Points Data Suite 10th in Yards After Contact Per Attempt (YACO/ATT), per Fantasy Points Data Suite All aboard the K9 train 🚂 pic.twitter.com/dCv6sT9IWr — Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) September 8, 2024 He remains a highly talented player. Some of Walker's efficiency metrics have not been great, but this can partially be attributed to Seattle’s poor offensive line play over the years. Like we mentioned above regarding De'Von Achane, a bad offensive line can skew running back efficiency metrics, and a good line can help. Look no further than Saquon Barkley this past season for proof of that statement. Seattle has done its part to try and fix the offensive line by drafting guard Grey Zabel 18th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft. Hopefully, he can bring some stability to this unit. Walker received plenty of volume in 2024, even with a new coaching staff in place. This indicates he is the team's preferred back over third-year pro Zach Charbonnet. The addition of new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak might be what unlocks the next level of Walker’s game in 2025. Kubiak has stated that he plans to put a lot on Walker's plate this upcoming season and that they are expecting big things from the fourth-year back. Walker is a priority target for me in the third and fourth rounds of fantasy drafts. I'm happy taking him as an RB2 to pair him alongside an elite receiver and another high-end back (cough cough De'Von Achane). I'm also fine taking him as an RB3 in a robust RB build. Walker came out as a firm RB1 in my 2025 PPR projections, so if the right scenario presents itself, I would also be ok taking him as my RB1. I've also placed wagers on a bunch of his rushing props as part of my NFL futures betting portfolio. What I am trying to say is that I am very bullish on Walker this year. He has all the talent needed to finish as a top-5 back, and it's only a matter of time before he puts it all together. I don't plan on missing out. Omarion Hampton - RB, Los Angeles Chargers While Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty got all the headlines as the clear-cut RB1 of the incoming rookie class, Hampton isn’t that far behind. Omarion Hampton Ranked in the 97th Percentile in Yards After Contact Per Attempt (4.3) ➖Age: 21 (Early Declare) ➖Size: 6’0, 220 lbsHampton’s Averages over the last 2 Seasons: ➖24 Touches Per Game ➖150.4 Yards Per Game ➖1.32 TD’s Per GameFuture Workhorse RB1 in the NFL pic.twitter.com/Dfd8kA8zIi — Austin Abbott (@AustinAbbottFF) January 29, 2025 The Chargers are very optimistic about Hampton's future and felt comfortable spending the 22nd overall pick on him in the NFL Draft. It's easy to see why. His tape is great, and he scored well in several advanced metrics. Among 154 collegiate rushers with 100+ carries, Hampton ranked 16th in PFF's elusive rating, eighth in PFF's rushing grade, and fifth in missed tackles forced (MTF). Hampton will have to beat out former Pittsburgh Steeler Najee Harris for the RB1 job in Los Angeles. While Harris was better in Pittsburgh than many would like to admit, he is not the same caliber of player that Hampton is. I am ok targeting Hampton as an RB2. However, I would prefer him more as an RB3 or flex play. He would be an ideal RB3 in a robust RB build. This is because he'll likely be slow to produce right out of the gates and probably takes on a Jonathan Taylor-type trajectory where he splits touches for the majority of the year before taking over the backfield by season's end. But that won't stop me from drafting him. I'll still have plenty of shares. Hampton is a super-talented player, and I am extremely bullish on his outlook for 2025 and beyond. This is another good, young running back to target in the fourth/fifth rounds of your fantasy draft. Los Angeles was arguably the best landing spot for a rookie running back, and it's only a matter of time before Hampton takes over this backfield. When he does, there will be some monster games in his future. Jordan Love - QB, Green Bay Packers There’s a narrative going around that Love regressed during his second season as Green Bay’s starting quarterback. While that might be technically true from a fantasy football standpoint (16.3 points per game in 2024 compared to 19.4 points per game in 2023), the data does not support this narrative. after spending the entire weekend researching & writing about the Packers 2024 season I 100% disagree w this on early downs among 46 QBs, Love ranked: #4 in YPA #5 in EPA/att #8 in successand that's despite being injured/playing thru injury half the year then on 3rd down... https://t.co/iATM6chesB — Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) June 2, 2025 Despite dealing with several injuries last year, Love still managed a well above-average touchdown rate of 5.9%. This was better than the 5.2% rate he posted in 2023 when he finished as the overall QB5. The main difference for Love was that Green Bay threw the ball significantly less last year compared to 2023. Love injured his knee and groin in 2024, and while he missed a few games with the knee injury, he managed to play through the groin injury. It’s more likely than not that the Packers staff knew Love wasn’t 100% healthy and therefore chose to run the ball more often to help him out. Love already has a top-5 fantasy finish to his name, and he’s finished with a high touchdown rate in each of his first two seasons. This is a clear trend and a sign that Love is capable of producing a huge outlier touchdown season if Green Bay airs it out more this year. The selection of receiver Matthew Golden in the NFL Draft, as well as the team's talk of further incorporating tight end Tucker Kraft (spoiler alert) into the passing game, suggests that Green Bay might throw the ball more in 2025. Love will be my primary quarterback target in leagues where I wait on quarterback or miss out on Joe Burrow. There is 40+ touchdown upside to his game, but most fantasy managers don’t realize this. Take advantage, and get him on your team. His MVP odds of 31-1 at FanDuel Sportsbook also make for an intriguing wager. Rashee Rice - WR, Kansas City Chiefs Rice was a popular breakout pick last season. It looked like things were on the right track, but then disaster struck. Rice suffered a serious knee injury in a Week 4 game against the Los Angeles Chargers. It was later revealed he tore his LCL and was ruled out for the season. Chiefs place WR Rashee Rice on injured reserve. pic.twitter.com/TuZ9sSaklw — NFL (@NFL) October 3, 2024 He only played in three games last year, but Rice’s advanced metrics will leave you salivating. Per Fantasy Points Data Suite, Rice posted an elite 35 percent targets per route run (TPRR) as well as a remarkable 3.47 yards per route run (YPRR). These are very high marks, and scores like these indicate a high likelihood for fantasy football success. A monster season could be coming for Rice. Mahomes ➡️ Rice, what a connection! 📺: #CINvsKC on CBS/Paramount 📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/5jkq5qhePc— NFL (@NFL) September 15, 2024 Rice is expected to be fully healthy for training camp, and it appears he is shaping up to be a classic Year 3 wide receiver breakout candidate. With Travis Kelce now another year older, Rice could potentially take over as Patrick Mahomes' top receiver. A 100+ reception campaign is a real possibility, and he can emerge as a PPR cheat code. Rice being available in the fourth round of drafts is what makes a robust RB start so appealing to me. Finding a potential WR1 in this range of drafts is the perfect target if you load up on running backs early. It can also help offset the fragility of a heavy running back build if one of your backs falls due to injury. Now, the obvious caveat is that you need to be correct about said wide receiver breaking out. To that end, Rice is a breakout pick I am highly confident in, as we saw it come to fruition over three games last year. The fantasy football community, however, is still skeptical. As long as he isn't suspended or injured, I believe Rice will finish 2025 as a WR1. His draft cost (48.23 overall in NFFC leagues) offers gamers a lot of flexibility in their drafts. There are many reasons to be excited about Rice’s 2025 season, and he could be a league-winning pick. Sign me up. Update - Rashee Rice has accepted a plea deal following his high-speed car accident in Dallas in March 2024. He was sentenced to 30 days of jail time and five years of probation. As a result, Rice will likely be forced to serve a suspension during the 2025 NFL regular season. At this time, the league has not made an official ruling, but the looming suspension could cause his ADP to drop, making him an even greater value. Tucker Kraft - TE, Green Bay Packers Kraft enjoyed a fine sophomore season in 2024 as he posted a 50-707-7 line. It culminated with a PPR TE10 finish. What a catch by Tucker Kraft for the TD! 📺: #HOUvsGB on CBS/Paramount+ 📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/5cpzRJLlEj— NFL (@NFL) October 20, 2024 With fellow tight end Luke Musgrave injured for the majority of the year, Kraft flourished as the team’s TE1. He even continued to function as the lead tight end once Musgrave returned healthy. Following Green Bay’s playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, head coach Matt LaFleur praised Kraft’s improvement and stated his desire to further incorporate him into Green Bay’s offense. Tucker Kraft Could Have Bigger Role In 2025 https://t.co/gwfiVJgXzX — RotoBaller NFL (@RotoBallerNFL) January 28, 2025 Green Bay did draft former Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden with the 23rd overall pick in this year's NFL Draft. This was a noteworthy selection because it marked the first time since 2002 that the team used a first-round pick on a receiver. While some took this as bad news for Kraft's value, the reality is that Golden is a good, not great, wide receiver prospect and profiles more as a WR2. He is a very good receiver against zone coverage, but still needs refinement against man and press coverage. For 2025 at least, he does not pose as great a threat to Kraft as some want to believe. I fully believe the discourse coming out of Green Bay regarding Kraft's role, and plan to aggressively target him in as many leagues as I possibly can this year. If you want to wait to address the tight-end position in your draft, then this is the tight end you want to select. Kraft's price is super affordable, and I plan to take advantage of his cost in my salary-cap drafts as well. Kraft has a great rapport with Jordan Love. His head coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterback have all said he will have a bigger role this year. Sometimes, spotting a breakout candidate is really that simple.

NFL Expert Picks: Best Fantasy Football Breakout Candidates for 2025,"NFL Expert Picks: Best Fantasy Football Breakout Candidates for 2025 Ain't no high like a hitting on a breakout high. When you snag a player who hits it big in fantasy football, you not only get a leg up on your competition, but you also get to look like a genius all year long. Those players who show their true ceiling can be league-winners, single-handedly carrying you to a championship. Which players are primed to break out in 2025? We polled our FanDuel Research writing staff to see who their favorites were. Let's see which players they think could move the needle in a big way for your drafts this summer. Fantasy Football Breakout Picks Austin Swaim Breakout Pick: Dalton Kincaid From an efficiency perspective in 2024, Dalton Kincaid did his job. He was ninth among tight ends who saw at least 50 targets in yards per route run (YPRR) at 1.73. However, he was 70th in catchable target rate (66.7%) among those that saw at least 10 looks, according to FantasyPros. That led to his being being Pro Football Focus' 15th-highest underperformer in expected fantasy points at all flex positions despite running just 58.9% of the Bills' routes. He's improved luck and a decent participation rate away from firmly being a top-10 fantasy tight end. Austan Kas Breakout Pick: Ricky Pearsall Ricky Pearsall checks a lot of boxes. He was a first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and got a delayed start to the season due to injury. He started emerging late in the year, blowing up for 8 catches, 141 yards and a touchdown in Week 16 before totaling 6 grabs, 69 yards and a score in Week 17. Heading into this season, Pearsall's path to targets has cleared up. Not only is Deebo Samuel in Washington, but Brandon Aiyuk is reportedly ""not anywhere close"" to a concrete return date while Jauan Jennings is currently banged up (or possibly holding in). There's a chance Pearsall is the top wideout for a San Francisco 49ers team that has the league's easiest schedule and that our Jim Sannes projects to score the eighth-most points. Although non-receivers Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle will hog plenty of looks, Pearsall looks like a strong breakout candidate. Annie Nader Breakout Pick: Keon Coleman We didn’t get any true breakouts among the Buffalo Bills' receivers in 2024, but Keon Coleman could break the mold in his sophomore effort. Coleman totaled 556 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns through 13 games in his rookie season. Notably, he put up three top-25 weekly finishes at his position before a wrist injury sustained in Week 9 partially derailed his campaign. Although drops were an issue, that’s not abnormal for a rookie, and he flashed upside by logging 19.2 yards per catch (third-most in NFL) and 7.4 yards after catch per reception (seventh-most; minimum 25 catches). The Bills replaced Amari Cooper and Mack Hollins with Josh Palmer and Elijah Moore this offseason. It’s still an annoying corps to navigate, but Coleman leads the way in untapped potential. Riley Thomas Breakout Pick: Marvin Mims Jr. The Denver Broncos had few productive fantasy pieces a season ago, but the team took a step in the right direction by making the playoffs for the first time since 2015. Bo Nix had a successful rookie season, and he could continue to make strides as we saw him rapidly develop in the later years of his collegiate career. While Courtland Sutton remains the clear top target, Marvin Mims could provide terrific value with his average draft position (ADP) of WR56 and 157th overall in half-PPR leagues, according to FantasyPros. Over the final five games of the 2024 season, Mims produced three top-10 weekly finishes; he even finished in the top six in the final two games. Paired with a jump in snap rate late in the season, Mims enjoyed a 29.5% target rate while scoring five touchdowns in the final five games. Following that production to end 2024, Mims should become a more consistent contributor. Skyler Carlin Breakout Pick: Drake Maye Although it's easy to see second-year quarterback Caleb Williams excelling under Ben Johnson in a revamped offense, Drake Maye is another signal-caller entering his sophomore campaign who can experience a breakout season. Even with seemingly everything working against Maye as a rookie, he managed to finish as the QB16 or better in 8 of his 12 starts to finish the year. Among quarterbacks with seven-plus starts a season ago, Maye averaged the most rushing yards per attempt (7.8) and produced 32.4 rushing yards per game despite getting only 0.6 designed rushing attempts per game, according to NextGenStats. In addition to expecting new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to call more designed runs for Maye to maximize his rushing ability, the New England Patriots did enough along the offensive line and receiver room this offseason to suggest we should see improvements across the board from the offense in 2025. Jim Sannes Breakout Pick: Bryce Young We gave a lot of helium to Bryce Young's improved efficiency last year, but his rushing gives him the path to a ceiling in fantasy. After Young regained the starting job, he averaged 22.3 rushing yards per game, maxing out at 68 in a Week 16 overtime win. His volume picked up near the goal line as he had 6 rushing attempts inside the 10, seventh among quarterbacks in this span. Now, Young's efficiency could creep up even more with Tetairoa McMillan in the mix. The Carolina Panthers' offensive line is decent enough, and the defense could funnel them into shootouts. Young has the building blocks for upside you want from someone who goes undrafted in most single-quarterback leagues. Take your sports betting to the next level with the FanDuel Parlay Hub!

"Best NFL DFS preseason week 1 picks for Thursday: DraftKings, FanDuel and more","NFL DFS picks: Week 1 NFL preseason daily fantasy football picks, Thursday lineups on DraftKings, FanDuel Get the best NFL DFS picks, sleepers and player pool for the preseason week 1 games on Thursday The Week 1 NFL preseason kicks off with a matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and Baltimore Ravens at 7 p.m. ET. The other two games on the slate are Eagles vs. Bengals at 7:30 p.m. ET, and Seahawks vs. Raiders at 10 p.m. ET. The Seahawks have a tight battle taking place for their backup quarterback spot behind offseason acquisition Sam Darnold. Rookie Jalen Milroe is expected to see extended action in his first professional appearance, while veteran Drew Lock is more of a proven commodity. At this point in the preseason, many of the established starters for each team will play sparingly (or not at all), making it imperative for DFS players to dig deep into the NFL DFS player pool for Thursday to find the top values. Should you build your Thursday NFL DFS rosters around Milroe or Lock? Or should you target a quarterback from another game like Anthony Richardson or Dorian Thompson-Robinson? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Thursday on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out the NFL DFS lineup advice, strategy and player stacks from SportsLine NFL daily Fantasy expert Jimmie Kaylor. Kaylor is a NFL betting and DFS expert for SportsLine, who opened the 2022 NFL season by winning DraftKings' NFL Showdown Thursday Kickoff Millionaire contest. He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. Anybody following his DFS picks over the last three seasons could have seen huge returns. Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to Thursday's 2025 NFL preseason schedule and locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine, also new players can get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5: Top NFL preseason DFS picks for Thursday One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for Thursday is Seahawks quarterback Jalen Milroe. Seattle drafted the former Alabama standout in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft in April, and his high-end physical ability has been turning heads during training camp. Milroe is battling Drew Lock for the Seahawks' backup quarterback job, but his athletic ability will make him a prime candidate to be a situational player as a rookie during the regular season. Milroe is expected to see extended action on Thursday night against the Raiders. His dual-threat ability makes him a threat to rack up DFS points as a runner, especially at this point in the preseason when passing games are still gelling and working on timing issues. If he ends up playing half of the game or more as expected, Milroe is a prime candidate to be the top-scoring quarterback on the slate. Part of Kaylor's Thursday NFL DFS strategy includes Colts running back DJ Giddens. The former Kansas State standout was one of the top running backs in college football in 2024. In his final two college seasons, Giddens rushed for 2,569 yards and 17 touchdowns, and he caught 50 passes for 581 yards and four scores. Giddens was widely considered to be one of the biggest steals of the 2025 Draft, and he has already been generating a ton of buzz during Indianapolis' training camp. With Jonathan Taylor and Tyler Goodson both expected to play minimally on Thursday, there should be ample opportunity for Giddens to shine in an extended role against the Ravens.

Fantasy football 2025: Top 10 league-winners,"The term ""league-winner"" gets thrown around in fantasy football all the time. But what is a league-winner? Often, it's a player who greatly outperforms his draft cost -- a late-round pick who breaks out to become an every-week starter, for example. It's also possible for a first-round pick to be a league-winner, but such a player must be historically good. Every year, there are players who take their games to the next level and completely change fantasy leagues. Don't you wish you knew about these guys before they broke out? I've got you. Here are my top league-winner candidates heading into the 2025 season. NOTE: Average draft position (ADP) is via FantasyPros' consensus rankings. The Bears’ top two receivers are in a prime position for league-winner status this season. Not only did Chicago make the premier play-caller upgrade of the offseason with the hiring of Ben Johnson, it also rebuilt the interior of the offensive line. A more creative passing attack under Johnson and more time in the pocket for Caleb Williams should lead to great results. We already know Moore can perform as a WR1 in fantasy, though last year he was limited by usage, leading to a career-low in air yards per target. Odunze didn’t hit as a rookie in 2024, but that was largely because he had the lowest rate of catchable targets and second-most unrealized air yards in the league, per NFL Research. Odunze has received praise from Johnson in camp, and it looks like he’ll operate as the Bears’ X receiver. With Moore currently the WR21 and Odunze the WR37 in ADP, there is a clear opportunity for both players to exceed expectations on the fantasy front -- especially Moore, who I rank much closer to a fantasy WR1 due to his versatility. Walker has always returned solid RB2 value, but the fantasy community has been waiting for him to produce a breakout RB1 season. He could be in position to feast in the Seahawks' new scheme -- a welcome sight for Walker after the Seahawks ranked in the bottom five in run play percentage in each of the last two seasons. New OC Klint Kubiak operates a heavy outside-zone run scheme, which should allow Walker to put up more chunk plays in Year 4. Last season under Kubiak, the Saints ran outside zone at the third-highest rate in the NFL (Seattle was 22nd). Walker, a solid pass-catching option for Sam Darnold, has yet to play a full regular season, but if he can stay healthy, he should outperform his current RB15 standing. The Lions offense was fantastic for years under Ben Johnson, but one thing it didn’t do often enough was throw the ball deep. In fact, only the Dolphins threw the deep ball at a lower rate in 2024, and in 2023, the Lions did so at the lowest rate in the NFL. New OC John Morton joined the Lions this offseason from Denver, where he spent the last two years as passing game coordinator under Sean Payton. The Broncos ranked 12th and third, respectively, in deep pass percentage over the past two seasons, per PFF. Implementing more deep shots would bode very well for Williams, who picked up 20-plus yards on the 28 percent of his receptions last season, the fifth-highest rate in the NFL. He also finished in the top three in fantasy points per target, yards per target and yards per catch among wide receivers. Williams has flashed breakout potential, but this could be the year he puts it all together. This season feels like the year of the rookie running back with several players in line to start from Day 1. The Chargers’ first-round pick is a very physical runner who has good wiggle for his size (6-foot, 220 pounds). He has the ability to carry the team’s rushing load on his shoulders and can contribute immediately in the pass game. Jim Harbaugh is known for leaning on the run, as his NFL offenses have only finished outside the top 10 in rush attempts once (11th, 2024). Veteran Najee Harris is missing valuable camp time due to a non-football injury, which helps open the runway for Hampton. And while there won’t likely be many strong fantasy options in the Chargers' offense, Hampton and second-year wideout Ladd McConkey should return early-round value. There are certain qualities I look for in running backs that I believe make them great fantasy football assets. The first is big-play ability. Henderson has blazing speed, and his college tape is littered with explosive runs. The other is pass protecting and receiving abilities. Henderson thrived in both areas at Ohio State, which should lead to him playing in passing situations -- a great way for backs to rack up fantasy points. In addition, with Rhamondre Stevenson a holdover from the old regime, the rookie has a real chance to be the feature back in New England. Not to mention, Mike Vrabel's teams have always been run-heavy in the past, leading me to believe Henderson has league-winning upside in the middle rounds. I labeled Swift the best running back value in fantasy drafts largely because he brings league-winning upside as the lead back in Ben Johnson’s offense. The Lions finished among the top two in RB goal-line carries and touchdowns in all three seasons with Johnson at the helm of the offense, and in each of those years, Detroit’s top two backs combined for more than 90 targets. Swift hauled in 48 receptions on 70 targets with Johnson in Detroit in 2022. Swift’s current ADP of RB21 is an opportunity for value. If you draft him at his floor, he could reward you with RB1 upside in one of the NFL's most fantasy-friendly systems. There are some concerns over how little the Eagles threw the ball last season, as they were one of just three teams to throw on less than 50 percent of their plays, per Team Rankings. That seems unlikely to happen again. But even with the low pass volume, Brown, who missed four games due to injury, was on a 17-game pace for 127 targets, 88 receptions, 1,411 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. Only Ja’Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson topped that receiving yards total, and he would’ve matched rookie Brian Thomas Jr.’s fantasy output. That projected production reflects an average season for Brown as an Eagle, as he topped 1,400 yards in both 2022 and ’23. Still, Brown is projected to be a mid-second-round draft pick. I don’t get it. But don’t pass on the opportunity to get a top-five WR in Round 2. There is a clear-cut top five at the quarterback position, and fantasy managers have to pay up to secure one of them. However, my guy Fields brings the same upside at a much lower cost. Dual-threat QBs are fantasy cheat codes, and the first-year Jet is one of three QBs to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Fields has also put up top-five QB numbers in the past; as Pittsburgh’s starter last season, he was on a 17-game pace for 3,134 passing yards, 14 pass TDs, three INTs, 655 rushing yards and 14 rushing touchdowns. That would equate to about 353 fantasy points, which would have made him QB6. Fields took a step forward as a passer in 2024 because he was asked to focus more on short, high-percentage passes instead of airing the ball out. That’s also what I expect with former Lions passing game coordinator Tanner Engstrand at the controls of the Jets offense. Detroit’s explosive offensive used a high volume of outside runs in 2024, and Fields ranks in the top two among QBs in yards and TDs on such runs over the last three seasons. Lastly, I expect the Jets to operate a version of the Tush Push with Fields under center. It feels as if a career year is on the horizon, and if it is, Fields could finish as a top-five QB -- at a low-end QB1 price. Achane finished as a top-five fantasy back last season and that might just be a launching off point. In the 11 games he played with Tua Tagovailoa last season, Achane averaged 22.6 fantasy points per game, which would have made him the RB1 had Tagovailoa stayed healthy over a full season. No running back picked up more points from receiving production than Achane, as Miami abandoned the deep ball and focused on short, quick throws to get the ball out of Tagovailoa’s hands. Achane also saw 70 percent of the team’s goal-line carries. He’s an explosive player who should continue to see plenty of volume on the ground, through the air and near the end zone. Yet, the potential RB1 overall is projected to go in the second round. Take advantage. Last year, I was called “click bait” for ranking Nabers the best receiver in his draft class. I was then told Nabers would not return top-20 WR value as a rookie after labeling him as a one of the breakout candidates in this space. One year later, everyone loves Nabers! The Giants second-year wideout is a first-round fantasy draft pick, but I’ll take it one step further and say he can return league-winning production. In 2024, Nabers led the NFL in target rate (31 percent) and set a league record for most catches in a season by a rookie receiver (109). He also had the third-most unrealized air yards (875) and ninth-highest rate of uncatchable targets (21 percent), while hauling in just five catches of 20-plus air yards, per Next Gen Stats. Watch his college tape and you’ll quickly realize that this is NOT a Nabers problem. The Giants greatly upgraded their QB room this offseason, signing veterans Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston and drafting Jaxson Dart in the first round. With Wilson in place as QB1, Nabers could very well lead the league in receiving yards. And if things break Nabers' way when it comes to scoring, he could be the WR1 overall in 2025.",2025-08-04,https://www.nfl.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-top-10-league-winners

Top 2025 Fantasy football picks The Fantasy football draft bible features 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, including: Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins: Tagovailoa has been a top-16 quarterback per game in three consecutive seasons, finishing in the top five in passing yards per game each year. The veteran signal caller is now heading into Year 4 in Mike McDaniel's offense, and with top wideouts Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle returning, the stage is set for Tagovailoa to hit the ground running in 2025. ""Tagovailoa finished 13th in Fantasy points per game among regular starters last year, and he consistently scores around 20 points per game when healthy,"" White said. ""With Jonnu Smith gone, Tagovailoa should return to more downfield shots to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, which gives him a solid shot at finishing in the 10-12 range at the position, well ahead of his average draft position."" Jordan Mason, RB, Minnesota Vikings: Mason impressed out of the gate last year with Christian McCaffrey unavailable for the 49ers, rushing for 685 yards on 134 rushing attempts and three scores during the team's first eight games. Boasting a far larger frame at 5-foot-11, 223 pounds, Mason could also be the favorite for short-yardage and goal-line work for the Vikings this season, making him an intriguing Fantasy football sleeper. ""Mason looked great as a complementary player in his first two seasons in San Francisco but was dominant as the team's lead back in the first half of 2024, pacing to a 1,620-yard season over the first seven weeks while suffering a shoulder injury late in that stretch,"" White noted. ""Aaron Jones set a career high for rushing yards and a career low in yards per attempt last year, and he turns 31 in December. If Jones starts to show his age or gets banged up at any point, Mason could run away with the RB1 job and become a top-10 Fantasy asset once again.""

The Best and Worst Fantasy Football Draft Spots for 2025,"Every year, fantasy football managers argue over one question perhaps more than any other: If you could choose your draft slot, which one should you take? It might seem like a small detail. After all, we all have access to the same player pool. But the draft slot you choose has a ripple effect. It shapes how your roster is constructed and what kinds of opportunities you’ll have for value throughout the draft. In full PPR leagues, especially those with 12 teams, the math changes depending on where you draft. Some slots provide clear advantages in consistency and draft control, while others force you to adapt to positional runs and tier cliffs. Multiple studies of win-rate data from high-stakes leagues like the FFPC show that early picks carry a measurable edge. Over the past five years, teams drafting from the first three slots post win rates 20-30% higher than those drafting in the middle. This is partly because the top-tier players in fantasy often have massive gaps in projected production over the next tier. In PPR leagues, the drop from WR3 to WR7 or RB4 to RB8 can be as much as 40-60 points across the season. Snake draft math also plays a role. While picks at the ends of rounds come with longer wait times, they offer control. A manager picking at 1.01 or 1.12 can dictate the flow of the draft by initiating runs or grabbing back-to-back players from the same tier. Mid-round drafters rarely get this advantage and are often forced to react, not plan. So, what’s the optimal draft slot in a 12-team fantasy football league in 2025? Here’s our ranking of every spot, 1 through 12, based on overall roster-building flexibility, tier access, and structural advantages over the course of the draft. You get your choice of the top player on the board, and in 2025, that edge is just as big as ever. The positional anchor you land here provides unmatched weekly scoring stability and opens the door for massive point-per-game advantages. You also control the board in every even-numbered round. While the long wait between picks can be painful, the reward at the top outweighs the risk. You still get access to one of the two premier fantasy anchors. That’s a big deal when tier breaks start hitting hard midway through the second round. This slot also gives you strong flexibility in Rounds 2 and 3. You’re early enough to control your build but far enough back to avoid the temptation of overreaching at the turn. This is the last guaranteed shot at the top tier of elite fantasy producers. If the first two managers go RB-WR or vice versa, you’re walking away with a cornerstone. Your second- and third-round picks allow for strong team balance, and the flow of the board sets up well for value in the middle rounds. The turn picks often get dismissed because of the long wait between turns, but 2025 offers great value at the back end. There’s tremendous depth in the early second round, meaning you can double-tap a WR-WR start or land a premium RB and top WR without sacrificing structure. Having two picks close together also lets you plan mini-runs before they happen. Many of the benefits of 1.12 still apply here, but you lose the flexibility of controlling the turn. You may find yourself having to reach slightly to secure your guys. Still, this slot allows for smart team builds, and the Round 2 talent pool is rich enough to build around. In past years, this spot might’ve been ideal. But there’s an argument that we already see a tier drop here in 2025. You’re now selecting at the beginning of a larger positional plateau. While your team can still be strong, you’re no longer guaranteed a true game-breaking asset. The value here depends heavily on Round 2 decisions. You’re close to the turn but don’t quite control it. This means you often miss on key pairings or positional value. You’ll also feel the squeeze in the third and fifth rounds, where players tend to dry up fast. That said, some creative builds can still come together here if you’re willing to go off script. This is a pure middle slot. You’re always in the middle of every positional run, often reacting instead of dictating. You do get access to players who just missed the top tier, but the gap between your picks can put you in a tight spot if you aren’t aggressive. Similar to 1.05, you’re trapped in no-man’s land, not quite early enough to land a superstar, and not quite late enough to control value swings. You’ll need to be sharp and nimble in the middle rounds, where the board is least predictable from this spot. While this isn’t the worst slot, it lacks identity. Your first-round pick is rarely elite, and by the time you’re back on the clock in Round 2, the best combinations are off the board. The best way to succeed here is to zig when others zag and embrace nontraditional builds. You’re too late to get a Tier 1 anchor, and too early to take advantage of second-round slip-ups. It’s easy to get stuck reaching to complete positional needs. Unless you hit on a breakout or two, the odds are against you here. This is the toughest slot to draft from in 2025. You’re caught just behind the optimal late-first and early-second pocket, and too far from the turn to capitalize on flow. Every pick feels like you’re chasing what just happened rather than shaping what’s about to come. 1. 1.01 – You get the best player on the board and strong control at the 2.10/3.01 turn, where premium pairings are still available in 10-team formats. Smaller leagues amplify the value of top-tier players. 2. 1.02 – You’re still landing a game-changing anchor and can double up with elite WR-RB combos at the 2/3 turn. 3. 1.10 – The last pick in Round 1 gives you control of the turn. With more depth in 10-team leagues, the 1.10/2.01 combo is loaded with upside. 4. 1.03 – Slightly behind 1.01 and 1.02 in terms of anchor value, but early enough to benefit from player drop-offs in the third and fifth rounds. 5. 1.09 – You don’t control the turn, but you’re close enough to secure strong stacks or positional builds with a mini-run in mind. 6. 1.04 – This is where the first round starts to flatten. You’ll likely land a low-end Tier 1 player and need to be sharp in Rounds 2 and 3. 7. 1.08 – You’ll find value in early second-round talent but may miss on the last elite options. Not bad, but a bit reactive. 8. 1.05 – Right in the middle of every round. Consistent but predictable. You’ll have to reach occasionally and rely on hitting value mid-draft. 9. 1.06 – Similar to 1.05 but with slightly worse odds of a top-three faller. No-man’s-land when it comes to dictating the draft. 10. 1.07 – Easily the most difficult spot to manage. You miss on elite early talent and have minimal control of runs on either side. Everything feels one step behind. There’s no such thing as a perfect draft slot, only the ability to recognize its strengths and build accordingly. That said, in 2025, the top of the board is as valuable as it’s been in years. If given the chance, take the 1.01 or 1.02 and don’t look back. You’ll be giving yourself the best possible foundation for a championship run. If you’re drafting from the middle, prepare to pivot often and attack value wherever it presents itself. And if you land on the turn, lean into roster structure. The board might not be perfect, but your execution can be.",2025-06-06T16:24:31+00:00,https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/the-best-and-worst-draft-spots-for-2025

14 Must-Have Fantasy Football Draft Picks (2025),"When I jump into any fantasy football draft, these players are going to be the first to hit my queue. Each category represents a few different targets depending on where I am in the drafting process, but these are my must-have players. 2025 Must-Have Fantasy Football Players Quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen own the top two tiers, however you want to order them, but in terms of return value, there is a tier of five. One of the reasons I love Burrow so much is that he lives at the end of this tier, with around 20-25 picks lower than the top two options. Burrow finished as the fantasy QB3 after leading the league in attempts, yards and passing touchdowns. The thing that does stand out is that it took him to be the leader in those big categories, and he still finished only third. That isn’t lost on me. What stays with me is that you get volume, and lots of it. The Bengals’ defense isn’t going to hold many back, which should lead to more offensive opportunities. The combo of Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins returning should lead to a huge floor for his passing yards. Rushing quarterbacks are still king, but you could put yourself in the position to draft more position players early. The late-round quarterback route is where I’ll go if I miss on Burrow, but the consistency you get while drafting three or four position players prior is weighted in fantasy gold. Justin Fields isn’t flashy in the traditional fantasy quarterback sense. The idea of drafting Fields as your starting quarterback can be a bit foreign, but it really shouldn’t be. Over his six starts, he scored five rushing touchdowns, recorded three 50-yard rushing games and passed 24+ times in four out of the six starts. This was in Pittsburgh. Going to the Jets, I like the offensive line better and the running backs with what they can do out of the backfield, plus Garrett Wilson‘s ability to get open with the right combo of wide receivers. Josh Reynolds‘ ability to play more short yardage and Allen Lazard‘s ability to stretch the field are also pluses. The supporting cast suits him well. Over those six weeks with the Steelers, despite some of the ugliness, he was still QB6 in fantasy. Fields’ FantasyPros expert consensus ranking (ECR) has risen from the teens to 10 from June to July, but in a majority of drafting spots, you’re going to see him available around the 12th quarterback. Here is what I love the most about late-round quarterback targets: you get one high upside signal-caller, like Fields, and then pair him with safe floor play like Jared Goff or Brock Purdy. Fields might be one of the best upside quarterbacks in fantasy that isn’t going in the top eight of drafts. Running Backs If you broke up the season into three pieces (Weeks 1-6, Weeks 7-12 and Weeks 13-18), Jahmyr Gibbs was never not an RB1 in points per game (PPG) in half-PPR. Take a look at his results in these buckets: - Weeks 1-6: RB10 - Weeks 7-12: RB3 - Weeks 13-18: RB2 This is just a story of consistency for a running back that explosive and built around upside. He did this despite David Montgomery sharing the backfield (Montgomery missed Weeks 16-18). Gibbs had the highest expected points added (EPA) among starters per carry, had the top breakout rate among all starters, according to PlayerProfiler and was the second best in true yards per carry (YPC) at 5.21. If David Montgomery wasn’t in the picture, I’d be comfortable with Gibbs as the top running back in the land. Despite Montgomery being there, Gibbs is still one of my favorite early draft targets when people are taking Saquon Barkley ahead of him. Anyone who knows me probably isn’t surprised that Christian McCaffrey is on this list. He is indeed an injury risk. The Niners were weird about giving out all the info, and it backfired. Running backs not named Derrick Henry don’t tend to age well, so there is a ton of injury risk. The counter is that he is a monster in this offense, and the 49ers won’t take their foot off the McCaffrey gas as long as he’s standing. We are a year removed from McCaffrey ripping off 2,000+ total yards and 21 touchdowns. Due to this risk, he is now going in the second round as the RB7. With the departure of Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk‘s injury, he’ll be counted on in the passing game as much as in the running game. Even if he takes a few plays off mid-series to preserve health, which could be an argument against him, he will dominate the red zone. That is without question. Figure out what you can stomach at running back, and if you can sprinkle in a little risk, McCaffrey could return as the No. 1 RB in fantasy in the second round. Chubba Hubbard finished 2024 as the fantasy RB13 in half-PPR. He put up almost 1,400 yards in 15 games played. Every game he received 20 carries, he was a top-10 fantasy running back. In seven games last season, he had 20+ touches in a game, finishing as a top-12 fantasy running back in six of them. The Rico Dowdle signing doesn’t do much to scare me off. It’s a cheap one-year deal. Dowdle is insurance, not there to take away. The Panthers found some rhythm at the end of the year, and I think that makes them sneaky. Hubbard is RB17 in the ranks, but RB19 in average draft position (ADP). He has RB1 upside and should be drafted everywhere. There is a big clump of rookie running backs that make up the 20 range of fantasy running backs, with Kaleb Johnson being the cheapest of the group, according to FantasyPros ranks at RB29. You can argue that Jaylen Warren could take on a bigger role now that Najee Harris is gone, but I don’t think the team wants that. I think they want to run it back how they did last year, and that’s why Johnson has a great shot to walk into significant touches. Johnson graded out high in Pro Football Focus’ (PFF) elusive rating, yet he may be used more as a north and south runner, which will work well in Arthur Smith’s offense. They won’t be afraid to throw to him in the open field with some of that elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability either. His ADP is what makes him so intriguing, with the lowest cost, in a run-heavy offense, making him a must-draft RB3 for your fantasy team. Master your draft with the latest rankings, sleepers, and strategy tips in our Best Ball Draft Kit. Wide Receivers If I can pair one of the top wide receivers with Ladd McConkey to start my draft, I’m doing it. He had the 11th-best receiving grade via PFF of wideouts with 100+ targets. Among wideouts who played qualified snaps, McConkey ranked fourth overall with 2.59 yards per route run. McConkey’s ability out of the slot to haul in targets, get yards after the catch and even put up an over 10 average depth of target (aDOT) looks to me like a Puka Nacua-lite. Some can argue that maybe his rookie year was the peak, but this team will want the ball in his hands, and they will find it across the middle at will. McConkey could walk out of 2025 as a top-five wide receiver in fantasy. Tet is going to be a matchup problem for cornerbacks for years to come. He’s 6’5, a great route runner, can play outside and in, and has a college track record of massive volume. He’s a wideout who is going to make the big play, but will the big plays come in Carolina is the real question. Bryce Young made some big strides towards the end of the year. He was the second overall QB in fantasy the final three weeks of the season. He found his rhythm and got the ball in the air. Now, McMillan will become his top target. In a world of fantasy where rookies get hyped beyond belief, it seems as though he is coming at a discount, outside the top-24 wideouts. Marvin burned us last year, but would that burn have been as impactful if he wasn’t going in the first or second round? It works out beautifully as well, so you can take him as a WR3 in most cases, who can then be paired shortly after with another vet. McMillan will be on many of my teams. What a messy year it was for Dolphins receivers. Year-over-year, Jaylen Waddle lost about a full yard per route run, which is a huge number. Part of this was the offense moving into more run plays versus how they used to stretch the field. The other culprit could have been Jonnu Smith, who is now gone. I’m not worried about Darren Waller, nor should you, and that should lead to Waddle being a force across the middle of the field again. He’s going off as the WR33, with top-20 wideout potential if the ball gets back in the air. There are a lot of mouths to feed in San Francisco, but I believe Jauan Jennings is still the most underrated, even after starting his breakout last year. Deebo Samuel is gone and Brandon Aiyuk’s injury leaves him up in the air. Jennings can and has played both roles in place of those wide receivers last year, and he earned Brock Purdy’s trust. Jennings played over 40% of his snaps out of the slot, which could increase with Ricky Pearsall on the outside. He averaged 2.24 yards per route run, which ranked 16th among wideouts, and an over 10 aDOT. I believe Jennings can be the No. 1 WR in this offense. Touchdowns will be key for him to become a top-20 wideout in fantasy or be a comfortable WR3 for your fantasy team. He’s one of the better values to invest in the Niners’ offense. Josh Downs is a pretty popular breakout for many. The reason is his dominance out of the slot and ability to stretch it into more. Had he not missed a few games, we could easily be looking at him with 80+ catches and 1,000+ yards. He ranks high in the yards per route department and tops among Colts receivers. Daniel Jones at quarterback might not be a bad thing for Downs, being a checkdown option. If Anthony Richardson comes back healthy and takes the next step, Downs could be a Jaxon Smith-Njigba-lite. His ADP is too good not to invest in. Coming into his second year, Keon Coleman is a great breakout target. He proved to be a big play target; we just needed more consistency and offensive targets. He averaged over 19 yards per catch, and even without serious target volume, could be this year’s Jameson Williams. When you get to the 40 range of wideouts, you should look to take a shot or two on high-ceiling players, and Coleman has the potential to take the top wideout spot in Buffalo this year. Tight Ends Travis Kelce has lost a step, but the pricing just seems off for a tight end who still brought in 97 balls last year. He was the most targeted tight end in the red zone, yet put up a career low three touchdowns. Rashee Rice’s return will take focus in the red zone, which should create positive touchdown regression just based on his targets alone. We are in an elite tight end world right now, and there is a chance Kelce could pop back to being a top-three tight end, but at half the cost. If I miss on the top options, Kelce becomes a prime target instead of trying to deal with late-round options. It’s hard not to imagine Evan Engram can become a favorite target of Bo Nix very early on. Sean Payton is going to move Engram around and create opportunities. The Broncos, outside of Courtland Sutton, suffered from no other real threat. Engram can not only be that, but also a force in the red zone. Engram represents the last of the “I need to draft this guy” tight ends, with real top-five tight end upside.

20 Must-Have Players (2025 Fantasy Football),"The 2025 NFL season is approaching, and that means it’s time to prepare for your fantasy football draft. What better way to do that than to practice drafting with our free mock draft simulator? Beyond our tools, we’re also going to have you covered throughout the draft prep season with our content. One of the most important aspects of completing a successful fantasy football draft is knowing who to target. Sure, there could be “value” that presents itself through the draft, but it’s important to know which players you should not only target as values but also those you need to circle on your cheat sheets and prepare to reach for if needed, especially in the early rounds, where everybody is good. It’s all about unearthing the best of the best. Here are my top players to target in 2025 fantasy football. Be sure to pair this with my early-round draft strategy (dropping soon in the 2025 FantasyPros DraftKit) to DOMINATE your league this year. Check out the dissenting opinions tool to see how my ranks stack up against ECR, ADP, and other fantasy football analysts at FantasyPros! Andrew Erickson’s Fantasy Football Draft Targets Quarterbacks In 2023, Justin Fields averaged nearly 22 points per game from Week 4 onward. In his six starts during the 2024 season, Fields was the QB6 overall and QB7 in points per game (19.1). He was fourth in fantasy points per dropback (0.62). Fields rushed for at least 27 rushing yards in five of his six starts (surpassing 50 rushing yards three times). The Jets’ new QB1 has similar fantasy upside to the elite QB Tier with his rushing ability. One that new head coach Aaron Glenn is all too familiar with during his tenure in Detroit as the defensive coordinator. Fields faced the Lions five times during his time with the Bears, rushing for 100+ yards in three of those contests. The Jets’ new head coach has already expressed a desire to utilize Fields’ legs, which should be of interest to fantasy football drafters. The passing is not nearly good enough compared to the S Tier QBs, but having his former Ohio State teammate in Garrett Wilson might help him take another step as a passer. The Jets have also added to their offense via the NFL Draft with offensive tackle Armand Membou and tight end Mason Taylor. Both players are expected to make immediate impacts as offensive starters. I’d also say Fields’ job security as the starter is relatively safe. They didn’t select a quarterback in the NFL Draft, and Tyrod Taylor is the backup. There will be no pressure to put Taylor in as the starter unless Fields is stringing together weeks of poor performances. Fields is currently being drafted as the QB12 in early best ball ADP. Drake Maye sits firmly entrenched in my top 12 fantasy quarterback rankings this season. The offensive environment in New England has only improved for Maye with offensive additions in NFL free agency and the 2025 NFL Draft. The Pats drafted offensive tackle Will Campbell, running back TreVeyon Henderson, wide receiver Kyle Williams, and center Jared Wilson. In free agency, they acquired wide receiver Stefon Diggs, offensive tackle Morgan Moses, and center Garrett Bradbury. They needed to bolster the offensive line and add explosiveness for their second-year QB. They achieved both. And don’t sleep on offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. As a head coach? Terrible. As an OC? You have my attention. He’s had past success with non-GOAT QBs: Mac Jones (rookie QB) and Cam Newton (mobile QB). And fantasy gamers can’t afford to ignore Maye’s dual-threat skill set. The Patriots QB HAS the cheat code. Last season, he ranked 5th in QB scramble efficiency (@PattonAnalytics) behind only the 4 starting QBs who played in the conference championship games. Among the seven passers in 2024 that recorded 30+ rushing yards per game (including Maye), five finished inside the top six scoring signal-callers on a per-dropback basis. What Maye was able to achieve as a rookie in a terrible situation cannot be understated. According to @NextGenStats, Maye was 1 of just 2 QBs to post positive EPA on tight window throws (The other was Lamar Jackson). He threw at least one touchdown pass in the 10 games he played fully as a rookie (finished on a streak of eight games overall as a rookie – the longest streak by a rookie since Justin Herbert in 2020. That resulted in 18.1 fantasy points per game, which would have ranked QB15 on the year. Maye’s current draft position is QB16, according to our consensus best ball ADP. He is the perfect late-round QB to draft. He is the archetype of a quarterback who makes the leap and wins leagues. Running Backs Over three seasons at Boise State, Ashton Jeanty rushed for 4,760 yards on 748 carries (6.4 YPA) with 50 touchdowns. The 5-foot-9 and 211-pound RB had just 10 fumbles on 748 carries (1.3% rate) and displayed steady year-over-year growth, particularly excelling as a receiver in his second season. According to Football Insights, Jeanty finished his collegiate career with the highest missed tackle forced per touch rate (39%). His career dominator rating ranks inside the top five. His yards per play (3.4) mark is also elite. His dominance as a junior, with a 43% dominator rating while rushing for an eye-popping 2,595 yards (6.9 YPA) and 29 touchdowns, puts him in elite company. The Las Vegas Raiders selected him 6th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft. In the desert, Jeanty is going to see all the volume he can handle. He will get all the touches he needs to score fantasy points. Also, during Chip Kelly’s four years as an NFL offensive coordinator, in three of those seasons, his backfields had a 16.6-17.7% target share, but he also flooded his Philly backfield with targets in 2015 (28.7%) per Derek Brown. Jeanty’s average draft position (ADP) in 2025 will likely be late in the first round based on his best ball ADP. But based on the proposition of talent/opportunity, it’s not a bad bet to make on the uber-talented rookie running back from Boise State. Historically speaking, the odds are in his favor to return on his late-round 1 ADP. The last two rookie RBs drafted highly in the first round two years ago – Bijan Robinson (8th) and Jahmyr Gibbs (12th) – finished as top 10 fantasy RBs in Year 1 (9th and 10th, respectively). The high-end rookies entering with top-tier draft capital post top-5 numbers during some pocket of games in Year 1. Tough to completely pass on in best ball with the contest structures heavily weighted from Weeks 15-17. And for redraft purposes, there are plenty of RB values that you can pair with Jeanty to help mitigate any slow start as he gets accustomed to the pros. We made it, fam. Chase Brown SZN is full-go. The Bengals’ lone addition during the 2025 NFL Draft was Texas Tech back Tahj Brooks, whom they selected in the sixth round. Zack Moss is still on the roster, but he is coming off a season-ending neck injury. Cincinnati brought running back Samaje Perine back after his one-year stint with the Chiefs. Ergo, the Bengals feel comfortable rolling with Brown and Perine as a one-two punch with Brooks providing a reliable depth option. That means Brown’s fantasy ceiling and elite role (or at least close to elite) is firmly back on his 2025 projection. His role last year was elite. Similarly to how the Rams have deployed Kyren Williams, Zac Taylor’s coaching staff has shown a willingness to deploy one back who plays almost all the snaps. Taylor said in a June 12th presser that Brown is making it a priority for the offensive coaches to get him the ball, despite the embarrassment of riches they have among their offensive skill group. After Moss went down in 2024, Brown took over the Cincinnati backfield in Week 9. He had an eight-game streak of 90+ yards from scrimmage. Brown was the RB5 in points per game (18.4) and the RB1 in expected points per game (22.3). The Bengals’ emerging star was Pro Football Focus’ (PFF) 14th-highest graded rusher and unquestioned bell-cow back, exactly like his final season at Illinois. With an elite receiving role to boot, Brown projects like a more explosive Kyren Williams in 2025. Brown ranks in the top 10 in my 2025 running back rankings and is the RB13 in early best ball ADP. James Conner continues to be one of the most underappreciated and bankable fantasy running backs in the NFL – and 2025 might be his best value yet. Despite entering his age-30 season, Conner showed no signs of decline in 2024. He finished as the RB11 overall and RB14 in fantasy points per game (matching Kenneth Walker per game pace) while playing 13-plus games for the first time since 2021. His 283 touches translated into 1,508 total yards and nine touchdowns, reaffirming his bell-cow status in an improving Arizona offense. What makes Conner’s case even stronger is how efficient he was, not just productive. From Weeks 10-18, he was one of PFF’s top-graded RBs, joining elite company like Bijan Robinson, Derrick Henry, and Josh Jacobs. According to Fantasy Points Data, in 2024 he ranked: - 2nd in missed tackles forced per attempt - 11th in yards after contact per attempt - 6th in explosive run rate - 6th in yards per route run - 7th in receiving yards per game Over the past two seasons, Conner ranks 10th among all RBs in total yards from scrimmage, sixth in rushing yards per game, and eighth in scrimmage yards per game (93.5) – the RBs ahead of him are all being drafted well ahead (minimum 24 games played) inside the 20 overall RBs. Given the ease of the opening schedule, I expect Conner to be very productive out of the gate for the Red Birds. Ride him till the wheels fall off. Ready to build a dynasty?

Get the edge and set your team up for long-term success. Etienne was a borderline disaster in 2024. He carried over his sluggish finish in 2023 losing work to Tank Bigsby playing in a bad offense heralded by a backup quarterback for the majority of the season. He was a flat-out bust after being a star in 2023. Although to be fair, Etienne still had a higher rushing success rate than Bigbsy, who flashed more as a boom-or-bust rusher. Etienne also battled through several different injuries. But Trevor Lawrence will be back and healthy for 2024, and the Jaguars have hired former Buccaneers OC Liam Coen as their head coach to bring this offense back to expectations. There will be no allegiance to either Etienne or Bigsby as the team’s starting RB and the new coaching staff could easily deploy a committee in a similar fashion to last season. In his opening presser, Coen stated that the Jaguars had two running backs who they could do many good things with. They also drafted two RBs in this year’s draft (albeit on Day 3). But in totality, this running game is going to improve dramatically. Coen’s rushing attacks have been prolific at each stop, coming from the Sean McVay-style run game. This guy got Rachaad White over 4 yards per carry. Wizardry. Even if the 26-year-old doesn’t get back to top 3 RB status, his one-down season hardly warrants such a drastically low ADP in a situation that looks favorable for his outlook in 2025. And so far, early offseason reports suggest he is going to stay in DUVAL county despite all the offseason trade rumors swirling around the Jaguars’ backfield. He’s done everything the new coaching staff has asked of him, and his connection with starting QB dates back to their time spent at Clemson together. It’s too early to write off Etienne entirely after an injury-riddled 2024 season, with him going outside the top 100 in back-end RB3 territory in early best ball drafts. Bigsby and Tuten still need to prove themselves to this new coaching staff as well, given their ball security issues. I love Tuten as a rookie sleeper (keep reading), but I can acknowledge it’s not his backfield from the jump. And if ETN gets traded to the Bears, Cowboys or some other RB-needy team, that might also be a WIN for his fantasy value. We love targeting ambiguous backfields for upside. That is Jacksonville’s backfield. If Etienne wins the starting job, he has easy top-15 upside in this Coen offense. Etienne has an RB3 and RB17 finish on his resume after falling off in 2024 (RB36). The Minnesota Vikings traded for Jordan Mason this offseason, and he is one Aaron Jones injury away from a full workload. The Vikings didn’t draft any backs in this year’s draft, and Ty Chandler fell out of favor on the depth chart last season. This is going to be a two-headed monster in Minnesota behind a revamped interior offensive line that has done nothing but upgrade with the acquisitions of Ryan Kelly, Will Fries, and Donovan Jackson. In addition to finishing fourth in yards over expected per attempt and seventh in rushing yards after contact last season, Mason ranked second in total rushing yards (667) before his injury in Week 8. I fully expect Mason to take on a larger role near the goal line, given that Jones struggled immensely in this area in 2024 (-14.4 EPA generated in goal-to-goal situations last season). We should see more rushing TDs from this Vikings offense after last season’s disaster at the goal line. Jones/Mason combined for 22 goal-line carries, but they scored just five TDs. 76 red-zone touches (Jones + Mason) resulted in seven TDs. The 2024 Vikings ranked 30th in carries per rushing TD (54.3). Only PIT and DAL were worse. That’s due to change. Entering last year, GB was last in carries per TD. Josh Jacobs had 15 rushing TDs in 2024. Positive regression hits hard, especially behind an improving OL. Draft Jordan Mason as RB36? Yes. The former Virginia Tech RB was selected at the top of the 4th round by Jacksonville, and is shaping up to be Liam Coen’s new Bucky Irving in Duval County. As previously stated, the new coaching staff has no allegiance to either Etienne or Bigsby, putting Tuten in a position to dramatically out-produce his draft capital. Tuten was a dominant producer at the college level with a career 30% dominator rating, highlighted by a 37% dominator rating last season (despite battling through an ankle injury). He finished the 2024 season top 10 in the FBS in yards after contact per attempt (4.4) among RBs with at least 100 carries. Also ranked 6th in the 2025 RB draft class in yards after contact per attempt and breakaway run percentage (54%). According to Sports Info Solutions, Tuten finished 1st in the class in broken tackle rate per 100 dropbacks. In 2023, Irving ranked third in that same statistic. The recent reports from OTAs haven’t been glowing for Tuten, but experienced fantasy games know this is the ebbs and flows of rookies. Everybody loses their minds drafting immediately after the NFL Draft, just for their prices to come down when reality settles in that there are still unproven players that have to earn their opportunities (especially Day 3 picks). The Jets want to run the football in 2025 with a stable of RBs. And that means we could see a lot of second-year RB, Braelon Allen. Allen earned a role as an extremely young rookie last season (20 years old), despite Breece Hall being healthy to start the season. Allen is a no-nonsense rusher and could very much be the “David Montgomery” in the Jets’ offense under new OC Tanner Engstrand (formerly of the Lions). Allen converted on 11 of his 12 carries on 3rd-1 last year, a 91.7% rate that was not only the best among all NFL backs in 2024 but the best by any back from 2021-24 (Jets.com). Expect with Justin Fields under center for Allen to take full advantage of wide-open rushing lanes. Wide Receivers Buy high on Drake London, who is a dark horse to be the No. 1 WR overall in fantasy football in 2025. We know the WR1 overall typically leads the NFL in red-zone targets, and that has been London’s calling card. The 25-year-old WR ended 2024 with 23 red-zone targets, tied for the third-most among all WRs (fifth in red-zone targets per game). The Falcons’ WR ranks first in red zone target rate over the past three seasons. He also operated from the slot more last season. London was one of the highest-graded WRs operating from the slot, third only to elite WRs: Puka Nacua and Nico Collins (PFF). He was also a target hog, with the third-highest target rate per route run (30%). London was targeted on 41% of his routes with Michael Penix Jr. under center. Red-zone targets have been one of the biggest predictors of high-end fantasy seasons at the position. His ADP is too low for the WR5 in total points through 18 games last season. After two years of hype, Jameson Williams finally delivered the breakout we’d all been waiting for. In 2024, the former 12th overall pick in the 2022 draft finished as the WR19 in total points and WR20 in points per game, posting 1,000+ receiving yards and 7 touchdowns across 15 games. He did so on just 59 receptions and 92 targets, showcasing elite efficiency and explosive playmaking ability, including ranking third in the NFL in yards after catch per reception. Williams truly turned it on down the stretch. After returning from suspension in Week 10, he was the WR10 in fantasy points per game (nearly 14) while commanding a 21% target share – almost identical to Amon-Ra St. Brown‘s target rate from Weeks 12-18 (excluding ARSB’s monster 18-target outlier in Week 15). Williams recorded 5+ receptions in six of his last eight games and hit at least 7 targets in every regular-season contest over that span. His late-season surge included three top 6 weekly finishes, a feat only 10 other WRs matched in 2024. He capped the year with a 61-yard rushing touchdown in the playoffs, further highlighting his dynamic skill set and game-breaking speed. Jamo is a big play waiting to happen. He has scored 9 of his 15 career TDs on plays over 40 yards (11 over 30-plus yards). All gas, no brakes. The arrival of new offensive coordinator John Morton, who already declared 2025 as a “breakout year” for Williams, might be exactly what Jamo needs to go to the next level. HC Dan Campbell is already onboard, stating that “the sky’s the limit” for Williams in 2025. If the Lions shift away from their slot Sun God-centric approach after Ben Johnson’s departure and diversify their passing game, Jamo could ascend to WR1 territory in fantasy formats. Given the recent news of Amon-Ra St. Brown undergoing off-season clean-up knee surgery, it’s just more fuel to the fire for Williams to play a bigger role in the Lions’ 2025 offense that could look a little different under a new play caller. Tetairoa McMillan lands in an ideal situation to emerge as the alpha wideout in Carolina. Drafted with top-10 capital (8th overall) the former Arizona star joins a Panthers offense in need of a true WR1. McMillan brings size, production and opportunity to a WR room featuring an underwhelming Xavier Legette and a promising but undrafted Jalen Coker. T-Mac was just one of 3 WRs in the FBS in 2023 to hit 1,396 yards, 10 TDs, and 89 receptions. The others being fellow top-10 WR draft selections: Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze. If Bryce Young takes even a modest step forward and continues to fuel fantasy success for his No. 1 target, McMillan could be this year’s breakout rookie receiver. Note that Adam Thielen surpassed both 100 catches and 1,000 receiving yards during Young’s rookie season. Last year in Dave Canales’ offense, the Panthers’ No. 1 WR between Diontae Johnson/Thielen was pacing for over 1,100 receiving yards over a 17-game sample size (33% first-read target share). In Thielen’s last six games, he averaged 14.6 fantasy points per game – a mark that would have ranked 8th among all WRs last season. I just can’t quit Jaylen Waddle. Even after he averaged barely nine points per game with Tua Tagovailoa last season and finished as the WR46 in half-PPR (WR56 in points per game). Waddle took a backseat in the Miami offense with Jonnu Smith and De’Von Achane vacuuming up the underneath targets. The games Tagovailoa missed further cratered Waddle’s numbers. It was bad. Even so, Waddle had just as many 100-yard games with Tagovailoa as Tyreek Hill (two), although he averaged nearly three more yards per target (8.0 vs 11.0). Waddle is also just 26 years old, and part of his down year was related to a lack of touchdowns. He scored six touchdowns in the last two seasons, compared to 14 in his first two years in the NFL. Given how the Miami Dolphins’ season ended, I can’t imagine they run back the same offense they deployed in 2024. If Hill continues his downward trajectory or Miami moves on, Waddle will benefit greatly. We saw glimpses of his upside at the end of the year. And the team just traded away Jonnu Smith to the Pittsburgh Steelers. In three of Waddle’s last four full games in 2024, he commanded nine or more targets, going over 99 receiving yards twice and averaged over 13 fantasy points per game. Despite the two down years, Waddle ranks in the top 15 in receiving yards through his first four seasons (3 seasons of at least 1,000 yards). I’ll take my chances with Waddle as a fantasy WR3 banking on a bounce back. Calvin Ridley quietly delivered solid fantasy football value in 2024, finishing with over 1,000 yards for the second straight season while leading the NFL in team air yard share (48%). While he only finished as the WR26 in total points and WR40 in points per game, he did outperform his WR35 ADP. Ridley’s late-season surge – 11.6 points per game (WR26) after DeAndre Hopkins was traded, essentially doubling his fantasy points per game – showed what he can do as the undisputed top option. With Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and his nine touchdowns gone, and first-overall pick Cam Ward now under center, Ridley could thrive as the clear No. 1 WR in a Brian Callahan-led offense. According to 4for4’s Justin Edwards, the Titans rank top-five in vacated targets to receivers and first to receiver targets inside the 10-yard line. If Ward is even average, Ridley’s elite usage profile makes him a strong bet to exceed his WR34 ADP. The Titans’ No. 1 WR could be a huge success in fantasy football, given his finish as the WR29 in expected points per game and WR17 in total expected fantasy points in 2024. Keep in mind that Ridley has never finished worse than WR26 in any healthy season he has played during his NFL career. Rome Odunze is a potential second-year breakout candidate hiding in plain sight. The former top-10 pick had a poor rookie season statistically – WR49 overall and WR66 in points per game – but the circumstances around him were far from ideal. Odunze dealt with a lingering MCL sprain early in the season, played in a broken Chicago offense led by an ineffective OC (Shane Waldron), and still managed to lead the Bears in high-value touches (air yards/red-zone targets) over the second half of the season. He ranked 10th in end-zone targets (14) and had 17 red-zone looks, but caught just 6 – a clear case for positive touchdown regression. Despite the dysfunction, Odunze flashed big-play/downfield upside with a 13.9 average depth of target (6th) and deep target rate. He outproduced Keenan Allen in air yards and red-zone usage and saw more valuable targets than D.J. Moore despite a lower overall target share. Now, in 2025, there are reasons to be optimistic. New HC Ben Johnson steps in after building a top-tier offense in Detroit. Veteran Keenan Allen is gone, opening up over 100 targets. The offensive line has been upgraded in free agency. Caleb Williams enters Year 2, with Odunze positioned to become his go-to target. And perhaps most importantly, Odunze is finally healthy. If Odunze earns more slot reps (where Johnson has historically funneled volume), he’s a screaming value at his current ADP. D.J. Moore was locked into a low-aDOT role (5.3) in the final eight games last year, which could make Odunze the Bears’ vertical and red-zone specialist – a high-value fantasy role on the field. Odunze has a WR3 floor with WR1 breakout upside. At worst, he can be a fantasy WR3 that Allen was last season for the Bears. Don’t be surprised if he emerges as Williams’ true No. 1 option as early as this season. We saw a glimpse of Odunze’s ceiling in a game that Allen missed in 2024 (Week 3 versus the Colts), going for 112 yards and one TD on 11 targets. All season highs. Keep in mind that the newcomers from this year’s draft (Colston Loveland and Luther Burden) have missed time during OTAs with injuries. Loveland is rehabbing his shoulder injury from college and Burden is dealing with a soft tissue injury. Marvin Mims flashed major upside in the second half of 2024, averaging 62 receiving yards per game and leading all WRs in yards per route run (3.63) from Week 11 onward. He also posted a strong 28% target rate per route run on the year, ranking 13th in the NFL. Still just 23 years old, Mims is a prime third-year breakout candidate in a Broncos offense looking to grow alongside Bo Nix. Tight Ends While injuries limited him to nine games last year (TE16 in points per game), Evan Engram still averaged over five catches per contest – classic PPR production. Engram has a history of strong Year 1 impacts with new teams (TE6 in first seasons with both the Giants and Jaguars). He now steps into a likely high-volume role in Denver with no established receivers behind Courtland Sutton. If he stays healthy, a return to top-five fantasy tight end status is well within reach in Sean Payton’s offense. In 2023, Engram posted a career-best 114 receptions for 963 yards and 4 touchdowns, proving to be a high-volume target in Jacksonville’s offense as the TE4 in fantasy points per game. He’s ready to embrace the Joker role in the Broncos offense. WHY SO SERIOUS? Another year, and another tale of two seasons for the Browns tight end. David Njoku finished 5th in fantasy points per game (10.6) and TE11 overall in 11 games played. The Browns TE missed three games to start the year and was placed on season-ending IR after Week 16. The 29-year-old TE was at his best with Jameis Winston under center, averaging north of 12 points per game (12.1). Equivalent to Brock Bowers. But for the second straight season, Njoku might have another new QB that wasn’t part of his hot streak the year before. At worst, Njoku’s ability to perform with different QBs the past two seasons is encouraging that he won’t completely fall off in 2025, regardless of who is throwing him passes. Let’s not forget the heater Njoku went on with Joe Flacco back in 2023 (five games): 15.4 fantasy points per game, 22% target share (9 targets per game) and a 29% target rate per route run. I’d also expect Njoku to remain a staple in the offense under new OC Tommy Rees, who served as the pass game specialist & tight ends coach for the Browns last season. Njoku finished third in expected points, third in targets per game (8.5) and second in end-zone targets (11) among TEs. The Browns tight end should easily see 100-plus targets in this offense so I am having trouble wrapping my mind around his TE10 price tag outside the top-100 picks. Once we get Flacco as the starter (my best guess to start the year), his ADP is going to surge. He is TE8 in the projections, but he is in the second tier, which is separated by five points. In 2024, Kraft led all tight ends in yards after the catch per reception (8.8) with an eye-popping 15 missed tackles. Second only to George Kittle in 20+ yard catch rate (22%). GB’s tight end ran away with the starting job over Luke Musgrave and never looked back, finishing as the TE8 overall and 10th in points per game (8.3). The Packers passing game never fully got unlocked with Jordan Love constantly banged up, but this receiving corps is wide open for somebody to step up. A roster filled with beta WRs looking for an alpha to emerge especially with Christian Watson suffering a torn ACL injury late in the year. Kraft has a real shot to lead this team in red-zone looks AND explosive plays after leading the team in red-zone targets with Love healthy last season (1/game). Head coach Matt LaFleur confirmed at the end of the season – that 100% – that Kraft has the potential to be a George Kittle or Travis Kelce type of player. Henry was quietly a top-12 TE in total fantasy points and expected points per game in 2024. Finished the year as the TE16 in PPG, coming off career-highs in receptions (66) and yards (674). And yet? He scored just two TDs. He tied for 5th in red-zone targets AND ranked 2nd in targets inside the 10-yard line. Positive regression, anyone? With Drake Maye under center in nine games last year: - Henry averaged 8.8 PPG - On pace for 85 catches, 850 yards If Maye makes a leap, Henry comes with him. The Patriots TE has averaged nearly 5 TDs/year since joining the Pats. He has a long history of red-zone usage, and is dirt-cheap in drafts. Let’s not forget that Henry’s best fantasy season came back in 2021 when Josh McDaniels was the Patriots’ OC.

With the 2025 NFL season fast approaching, it's the perfect time to prep for your fantasy football drafts using the most accurate single-quarterback, redraft PPR rankings available. Curated by Nathan Jahnke — one of the industry’s most accurate rankers and a multi-time top-five finisher in the FantasyPros Accuracy Competition — these rankings are built on current depth charts, projected roles and coaching trends to spotlight players poised for early and sustained success. Last updated: Monday, July 28 1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals Chase led all wide receivers in fantasy points and fantasy points per game last season. He’s consistently graded as a top-10 wide receiver, with his fantasy performance elevated by his environment. The Bengals made no changes to the coaching staff impacting Chase, the quarterback room, the wide receiver room or the tight end room. This puts Chase in one of the most pass-friendly environments in the NFL, catching passes from the best passer. While we should expect regression from anyone who finishes first in fantasy points, the lack of changes in Cincinnati should help minimize the regression. 2. RB Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons Bijan Robinson was a rare top-10 NFL draft pick at running back, leading to hefty expectations. He began meeting those expectations over the second half of 2024, consistently playing over 70% of the Falcons' offensive snaps and running at least 17 times in all but one game. This led to 22.4 fantasy points per game over the last nine weeks. He didn’t see as many 15-plus-yard carries as other great running backs, even though he’s got the talent and speed to have those runs. It’s possible some positive regression could greatly help his fantasy production this season. He lost Drew Dalman at center and still has an elite backup in Tyler Allgeier, so there is also some room to lose fantasy value. 3. RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Detroit Lions Gibbs was the 12th overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft and is one of just three running backs selected with a top-20 pick in the last seven drafts. His playing time has been limited the past two seasons as he splits time with David Montgomery. He’s managed to be an elite fantasy option with the most fantasy points per carry over the last two seasons of any running back. When Montgomery was injured late last season, he showed he could be the best running back in fantasy football if given enough opportunity. The Lions have a new offensive coordinator and new running back coach, which could lead to an increase in chances for Gibbs, pushing him closer to the top of the fantasy draft board. 4. WR Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings Jefferson has been the best wide receiver in the NFL since he was drafted in 2020, with a league-leading 93.6 receiving grade. He also ranks first in receiving yards per game at 96.5 and yards per route run at 2.64. He’s among the top five fantasy wide receivers in the last four seasons. No other wide receiver has accomplished that more than twice in those four years. In the previous three seasons, his fantasy points per game have been three points higher with Kirk Cousins compared to without him. That’s the difference between a top-five finish and a top-10 finish. Jefferson’s fantasy finish will depend heavily on J.J. McCarthy‘s development. 5. WR Brian Thomas Jr., Jacksonville Jaguars Brian Thomas Jr. had a strong start to his rookie season and ended it among the league’s best fantasy receivers. In his final seven games, he gained at least 13 PPR points each week and averaged 21.5 points, third behind only Ja’Marr Chase and Puka Nacua. He played at least 84% of his team’s offensive snaps in all but one of those games. The team added Travis Hunter in the draft, and he will see a decent target rate, but typically, two great wide receivers can co-exist as long as there isn’t much more competition for targets. Thomas led all wide receivers in yards per route run out of the slot with 3.12, and new offensive coordinator Liam Coen has found a lot of success with his slot receivers in the past. An increased role in the slot could lead Thomas to remain among the top wide receivers in fantasy football.",2025-07-28,https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025

7 League-Winning Fantasy Football Draft Picks: Dave's Must-Have Players (2025),"Dave's must-have players to draft for 2025 fantasy football leagues. His league-winning draft picks and players outlooks, including Jordan Love, De'Von Achane, and more. Summer is in full swing, and we have almost reached July. While many are currently enjoying the warm weather and fun activities, fantasy football players know what the start of summer means. NFL training camps will soon begin, and the start of another fantasy football season is upon us. Many gamers have already begun meticulously planning for their 2025 fantasy football draft. One of the best ways managers can do so is to identify high-upside players who should be priority draft picks. This is a great way to gain an edge over your league mates and could help you finally win your league's coveted championship trophy. To that end, there are quite a few players I have targeted across my dynasty portfolio, and I plan to invest heavily in these same players in my redraft leagues as well. Admittedly, this is an extensive list. So, for our purposes today, I’ve narrowed things down to the top seven names I am most bullish on this year. These are players you should aggressively target in your drafts, as they are capable of producing league-winning results. Make sure you’re following RotoBaller on X and check out RotoBaller.com for all your fantasy football needs. Here are my seven must-draft players for 2025 fantasy football leagues.

He threw for a career-high 4,918 passing yards and 43 touchdowns last year. As a result, Burrow finished 2024 as the overall QB3. BURROW TO CHASE. 41-YARD TD. 📺: #WASvsCIN on ABC 📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/DJW1LY5mdS— NFL (@NFL) September 24, 2024 With the team re-signing wide receiver Tee Higgins and tight end Mike Gesicki this offseason, Burrow will once again enter the 2025 season with a strong arsenal of weapons. Also working in his favor is the fact that Cincinnati has failed to adequately fix a defense that plagued the team in 2024. The Bengals' approach to fixing their defense can be described as questionable at best, but it means the team’s defense likely isn’t much better than last year. That's good news for Burrow's fantasy outlook as Cincinnati's offense will be forced to score a ton of points again in 2025. Burrow is a must-draft if he falls to the fifth round of fantasy drafts, and there’s nothing wrong with reaching for him a little early. I plan on doing so if necessary. He’ll be a player I heavily target in all my salary-cap drafts as well. Burrow is primed for another huge year and is a real threat to post a 5,000-yard, 50-touchdown season in 2025. De’Von Achane - RB, Miami Dolphins After averaging an absurd 7.8 yards per carry as a rookie, Achane’s efficiency took a step back in 2024. He only averaged 4.5 yards per carry last year. However, Achane received considerably more work as a sophomore and totaled 1,499 scrimmage yards and scored 12 total touchdowns. A robust 78 receptions would help him finish the season as the PPR RB5.

Many of his advanced metrics also took a step back last year compared to 2023. However, Miami’s offensive line was not good last year, and offensive line play can skew running back metrics. The Dolphins also appear committed to repeating their offensive approach from a year ago, and that gives Achane a safe floor as a pass-catcher. It's worth noting that Miami has taken steps to address its offensive line. But even if those changes don't help, we already know Achane can be a top-5 back behind a poor offensive line. What do people think will happen if the offensive line is better and Achane's efficiency bounces back? Bottom line: Achane can easily finish as a top-3 back and is live for an overall RB1 finish. This is a great chance to get a high-end RB1 in your draft at a discounted rate. Opportunities like this don’t come around often. I’ll wind up with a lot of Achane shares across all of my redraft leagues and have no problem reaching for him at the end of the first round. I’ll also happily take him as my RB1 in my salary-cap drafts as a cheaper alternative to Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs. With tight end Jonnu Smith now in Pittsburgh, Achane could see even more targets in the passing game. The fantasy football community is still not appropriately valuing Achane's upside. Don’t make this mistake in your draft. Kenneth Walker III - RB, Seattle Seahawks While his raw stats disappointed last year, Walker still posted some strong advanced metrics. Among 46 backs with 100+ carries, Walker finished: First in Missed Tackles Forced Per Attempt (MTF/ATT), per Fantasy Points Data Suite Third in PFF Elusive Rating Fifth in PFF Rushing Grade Ninth in Missed Tackles Forced (MTF), per Fantasy Points Data Suite 10th in Yards After Contact Per Attempt (YACO/ATT), per Fantasy Points Data Suite All aboard the K9 train 🚂 pic.twitter.com/dCv6sT9IWr — Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) September 8, 2024 He remains a highly talented player. Some of Walker's efficiency metrics have not been great, but this can partially be attributed to Seattle’s poor offensive line play over the years. Like we mentioned above regarding De'Von Achane, a bad offensive line can skew running back efficiency metrics, and a good line can help. Look no further than Saquon Barkley this past season for proof of that statement. Seattle has done its part to try and fix the offensive line by drafting guard Grey Zabel 18th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft. Hopefully, he can bring some stability to this unit. Walker received plenty of volume in 2024, even with a new coaching staff in place. This indicates he is the team's preferred back over third-year pro Zach Charbonnet. The addition of new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak might be what unlocks the next level of Walker’s game in 2025. Kubiak has stated that he plans to put a lot on Walker's plate this upcoming season and that they are expecting big things from the fourth-year back. Walker is a priority target for me in the third and fourth rounds of fantasy drafts. I'm happy taking him as an RB2 to pair him alongside an elite receiver and another high-end back (cough cough De'Von Achane). I'm also fine taking him as an RB3 in a robust RB build. Walker came out as a firm RB1 in my 2025 PPR projections, so if the right scenario presents itself, I would also be ok taking him as my RB1. I've also placed wagers on a bunch of his rushing props as part of my NFL futures betting portfolio. What I am trying to say is that I am very bullish on Walker this year. He has all the talent needed to finish as a top-5 back, and it's only a matter of time before he puts it all together. I don't plan on missing out. Omarion Hampton - RB, Los Angeles Chargers While Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty got all the headlines as the clear-cut RB1 of the incoming rookie class, Hampton isn’t that far behind. Omarion Hampton Ranked in the 97th Percentile in Yards After Contact Per Attempt (4.3) ➖Age: 21 (Early Declare) ➖Size: 6’0, 220 lbsHampton’s Averages over the last 2 Seasons: ➖24 Touches Per Game ➖150.4 Yards Per Game ➖1.32 TD’s Per GameFuture Workhorse RB1 in the NFL pic.twitter.com/Dfd8kA8zIi — Austin Abbott (@AustinAbbottFF) January 29, 2025 The Chargers are very optimistic about Hampton's future and felt comfortable spending the 22nd overall pick on him in the NFL Draft. It's easy to see why. His tape is great, and he scored well in several advanced metrics. Among 154 collegiate rushers with 100+ carries, Hampton ranked 16th in PFF's elusive rating, eighth in PFF's rushing grade, and fifth in missed tackles forced (MTF). Hampton will have to beat out former Pittsburgh Steeler Najee Harris for the RB1 job in Los Angeles. While Harris was better in Pittsburgh than many would like to admit, he is not the same caliber of player that Hampton is. I am ok targeting Hampton as an RB2. However, I would prefer him more as an RB3 or flex play. He would be an ideal RB3 in a robust RB build. This is because he'll likely be slow to produce right out of the gates and probably takes on a Jonathan Taylor-type trajectory where he splits touches for the majority of the year before taking over the backfield by season's end. But that won't stop me from drafting him. I'll still have plenty of shares. Hampton is a super-talented player, and I am extremely bullish on his outlook for 2025 and beyond. This is another good, young running back to target in the fourth/fifth rounds of your fantasy draft. Los Angeles was arguably the best landing spot for a rookie running back, and it's only a matter of time before Hampton takes over this backfield. When he does, there will be some monster games in his future. Jordan Love - QB, Green Bay Packers There’s a narrative going around that Love regressed during his second season as Green Bay’s starting quarterback. While that might be technically true from a fantasy football standpoint (16.3 points per game in 2024 compared to 19.4 points per game in 2023), the data does not support this narrative. after spending the entire weekend researching & writing about the Packers 2024 season I 100% disagree w this on early downs among 46 QBs, Love ranked: #4 in YPA #5 in EPA/att #8 in successand that's despite being injured/playing thru injury half the year then on 3rd down... https://t.co/iATM6chesB — Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) June 2, 2025 Despite dealing with several injuries last year, Love still managed a well above-average touchdown rate of 5.9%. This was better than the 5.2% rate he posted in 2023 when he finished as the overall QB5. The main difference for Love was that Green Bay threw the ball significantly less last year compared to 2023. Love injured his knee and groin in 2024, and while he missed a few games with the knee injury, he managed to play through the groin injury. It’s more likely than not that the Packers staff knew Love wasn’t 100% healthy and therefore chose to run the ball more often to help him out. Love already has a top-5 fantasy finish to his name, and he’s finished with a high touchdown rate in each of his first two seasons. This is a clear trend and a sign that Love is capable of producing a huge outlier touchdown season if Green Bay airs it out more this year. The selection of receiver Matthew Golden in the NFL Draft, as well as the team's talk of further incorporating tight end Tucker Kraft (spoiler alert) into the passing game, suggests that Green Bay might throw the ball more in 2025. Love will be my primary quarterback target in leagues where I wait on quarterback or miss out on Joe Burrow. There is 40+ touchdown upside to his game, but most fantasy managers don’t realize this. Take advantage, and get him on your team. His MVP odds of 31-1 at FanDuel Sportsbook also make for an intriguing wager. Rashee Rice - WR, Kansas City Chiefs Rice was a popular breakout pick last season. It looked like things were on the right track, but then disaster struck. Rice suffered a serious knee injury in a Week 4 game against the Los Angeles Chargers. It was later revealed he tore his LCL and was ruled out for the season. Chiefs place WR Rashee Rice on injured reserve. pic.twitter.com/TuZ9sSaklw — NFL (@NFL) October 3, 2024 He only played in three games last year, but Rice’s advanced metrics will leave you salivating. Per Fantasy Points Data Suite, Rice posted an elite 35 percent targets per route run (TPRR) as well as a remarkable 3.47 yards per route run (YPRR). These are very high marks, and scores like these indicate a high likelihood for fantasy football success. A monster season could be coming for Rice. Mahomes ➡️ Rice, what a connection! 📺: #CINvsKC on CBS/Paramount 📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/5jkq5qhePc— NFL (@NFL) September 15, 2024 Rice is expected to be fully healthy for training camp, and it appears he is shaping up to be a classic Year 3 wide receiver breakout candidate. With Travis Kelce now another year older, Rice could potentially take over as Patrick Mahomes' top receiver. A 100+ reception campaign is a real possibility, and he can emerge as a PPR cheat code. Rice being available in the fourth round of drafts is what makes a robust RB start so appealing to me. Finding a potential WR1 in this range of drafts is the perfect target if you load up on running backs early. It can also help offset the fragility of a heavy running back build if one of your backs falls due to injury. Now, the obvious caveat is that you need to be correct about said wide receiver breaking out. To that end, Rice is a breakout pick I am highly confident in, as we saw it come to fruition over three games last year. The fantasy football community, however, is still skeptical. As long as he isn't suspended or injured, I believe Rice will finish 2025 as a WR1. His draft cost (48.23 overall in NFFC leagues) offers gamers a lot of flexibility in their drafts. There are many reasons to be excited about Rice’s 2025 season, and he could be a league-winning pick. Sign me up. Update - Rashee Rice has accepted a plea deal following his high-speed car accident in Dallas in March 2024. He was sentenced to 30 days of jail time and five years of probation. As a result, Rice will likely be forced to serve a suspension during the 2025 NFL regular season. At this time, the league has not made an official ruling, but the looming suspension could cause his ADP to drop, making him an even greater value. Tucker Kraft - TE, Green Bay Packers Kraft enjoyed a fine sophomore season in 2024 as he posted a 50-707-7 line. It culminated with a PPR TE10 finish. What a catch by Tucker Kraft for the TD! 📺: #HOUvsGB on CBS/Paramount+ 📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/5cpzRJLlEj— NFL (@NFL) October 20, 2024 With fellow tight end Luke Musgrave injured for the majority of the year, Kraft flourished as the team’s TE1. He even continued to function as the lead tight end once Musgrave returned healthy. Following Green Bay’s playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, head coach Matt LaFleur praised Kraft’s improvement and stated his desire to further incorporate him into Green Bay’s offense. Tucker Kraft Could Have Bigger Role In 2025 https://t.co/gwfiVJgXzX — RotoBaller NFL (@RotoBallerNFL) January 28, 2025 Green Bay did draft former Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden with the 23rd overall pick in this year's NFL Draft. This was a noteworthy selection because it marked the first time since 2002 that the team used a first-round pick on a receiver. While some took this as bad news for Kraft's value, the reality is that Golden is a good, not great, wide receiver prospect and profiles more as a WR2. He is a very good receiver against zone coverage, but still needs refinement against man and press coverage. For 2025 at least, he does not pose as great a threat to Kraft as some want to believe. I fully believe the discourse coming out of Green Bay regarding Kraft's role, and plan to aggressively target him in as many leagues as I possibly can this year. If you want to wait to address the tight-end position in your draft, then this is the tight end you want to select. Kraft's price is super affordable, and I plan to take advantage of his cost in my salary-cap drafts as well. Kraft has a great rapport with Jordan Love. His head coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterback have all said he will have a bigger role this year. Sometimes, spotting a breakout candidate is really that simple.

NFL Expert Picks: Best Fantasy Football Breakout Candidates for 2025,"NFL Expert Picks: Best Fantasy Football Breakout Candidates for 2025 Ain't no high like a hitting on a breakout high. When you snag a player who hits it big in fantasy football, you not only get a leg up on your competition, but you also get to look like a genius all year long. Those players who show their true ceiling can be league-winners, single-handedly carrying you to a championship. Which players are primed to break out in 2025? We polled our FanDuel Research writing staff to see who their favorites were. Let's see which players they think could move the needle in a big way for your drafts this summer. Fantasy Football Breakout Picks Austin Swaim Breakout Pick: Dalton Kincaid From an efficiency perspective in 2024, Dalton Kincaid did his job. He was ninth among tight ends who saw at least 50 targets in yards per route run (YPRR) at 1.73. However, he was 70th in catchable target rate (66.7%) among those that saw at least 10 looks, according to FantasyPros. That led to his being being Pro Football Focus' 15th-highest underperformer in expected fantasy points at all flex positions despite running just 58.9% of the Bills' routes. He's improved luck and a decent participation rate away from firmly being a top-10 fantasy tight end. Austan Kas Breakout Pick: Ricky Pearsall Ricky Pearsall checks a lot of boxes. He was a first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and got a delayed start to the season due to injury. He started emerging late in the year, blowing up for 8 catches, 141 yards and a touchdown in Week 16 before totaling 6 grabs, 69 yards and a score in Week 17. Heading into this season, Pearsall's path to targets has cleared up. Not only is Deebo Samuel in Washington, but Brandon Aiyuk is reportedly ""not anywhere close"" to a concrete return date while Jauan Jennings is currently banged up (or possibly holding in). There's a chance Pearsall is the top wideout for a San Francisco 49ers team that has the league's easiest schedule and that our Jim Sannes projects to score the eighth-most points. Although non-receivers Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle will hog plenty of looks, Pearsall looks like a strong breakout candidate. Annie Nader Breakout Pick: Keon Coleman We didn’t get any true breakouts among the Buffalo Bills' receivers in 2024, but Keon Coleman could break the mold in his sophomore effort. Coleman totaled 556 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns through 13 games in his rookie season. Notably, he put up three top-25 weekly finishes at his position before a wrist injury sustained in Week 9 partially derailed his campaign. Although drops were an issue, that’s not abnormal for a rookie, and he flashed upside by logging 19.2 yards per catch (third-most in NFL) and 7.4 yards after catch per reception (seventh-most; minimum 25 catches). The Bills replaced Amari Cooper and Mack Hollins with Josh Palmer and Elijah Moore this offseason. It’s still an annoying corps to navigate, but Coleman leads the way in untapped potential. Riley Thomas Breakout Pick: Marvin Mims Jr. The Denver Broncos had few productive fantasy pieces a season ago, but the team took a step in the right direction by making the playoffs for the first time since 2015. Bo Nix had a successful rookie season, and he could continue to make strides as we saw him rapidly develop in the later years of his collegiate career. While Courtland Sutton remains the clear top target, Marvin Mims could provide terrific value with his average draft position (ADP) of WR56 and 157th overall in half-PPR leagues, according to FantasyPros. Over the final five games of the 2024 season, Mims produced three top-10 weekly finishes; he even finished in the top six in the final two games. Paired with a jump in snap rate late in the season, Mims enjoyed a 29.5% target rate while scoring five touchdowns in the final five games. Following that production to end 2024, Mims should become a more consistent contributor. Skyler Carlin Breakout Pick: Drake Maye Although it's easy to see second-year quarterback Caleb Williams excelling under Ben Johnson in a revamped offense, Drake Maye is another signal-caller entering his sophomore campaign who can experience a breakout season. Even with seemingly everything working against Maye as a rookie, he managed to finish as the QB16 or better in 8 of his 12 starts to finish the year. Among quarterbacks with seven-plus starts a season ago, Maye averaged the most rushing yards per attempt (7.8) and produced 32.4 rushing yards per game despite getting only 0.6 designed rushing attempts per game, according to NextGenStats. In addition to expecting new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to call more designed runs for Maye to maximize his rushing ability, the New England Patriots did enough along the offensive line and receiver room this offseason to suggest we should see improvements across the board from the offense in 2025. Jim Sannes Breakout Pick: Bryce Young We gave a lot of helium to Bryce Young's improved efficiency last year, but his rushing gives him the path to a ceiling in fantasy. After Young regained the starting job, he averaged 22.3 rushing yards per game, maxing out at 68 in a Week 16 overtime win. His volume picked up near the goal line as he had 6 rushing attempts inside the 10, seventh among quarterbacks in this span. Now, Young's efficiency could creep up even more with Tetairoa McMillan in the mix. The Carolina Panthers' offensive line is decent enough, and the defense could funnel them into shootouts. Young has the building blocks for upside you want from someone who goes undrafted in most single-quarterback leagues. Take your sports betting to the next level with the FanDuel Parlay Hub!

"Best NFL DFS preseason week 1 picks for Thursday: DraftKings, FanDuel and more","NFL DFS picks: Week 1 NFL preseason daily fantasy football picks, Thursday lineups on DraftKings, FanDuel Get the best NFL DFS picks, sleepers and player pool for the preseason week 1 games on Thursday The Week 1 NFL preseason kicks off with a matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and Baltimore Ravens at 7 p.m. ET. The other two games on the slate are Eagles vs. Bengals at 7:30 p.m. ET, and Seahawks vs. Raiders at 10 p.m. ET. The Seahawks have a tight battle taking place for their backup quarterback spot behind offseason acquisition Sam Darnold. Rookie Jalen Milroe is expected to see extended action in his first professional appearance, while veteran Drew Lock is more of a proven commodity. At this point in the preseason, many of the established starters for each team will play sparingly (or not at all), making it imperative for DFS players to dig deep into the NFL DFS player pool for Thursday to find the top values. Should you build your Thursday NFL DFS rosters around Milroe or Lock? Or should you target a quarterback from another game like Anthony Richardson or Dorian Thompson-Robinson? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Thursday on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out the NFL DFS lineup advice, strategy and player stacks from SportsLine NFL daily Fantasy expert Jimmie Kaylor. Kaylor is a NFL betting and DFS expert for SportsLine, who opened the 2022 NFL season by winning DraftKings' NFL Showdown Thursday Kickoff Millionaire contest. He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks. Anybody following his DFS picks over the last three seasons could have seen huge returns. Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to Thursday's 2025 NFL preseason schedule and locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine, also new players can get $50 in Pick6 credits at DraftKings when they play $5: Top NFL preseason DFS picks for Thursday One of Kaylor's top DFS picks for Thursday is Seahawks quarterback Jalen Milroe. Seattle drafted the former Alabama standout in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft in April, and his high-end physical ability has been turning heads during training camp. Milroe is battling Drew Lock for the Seahawks' backup quarterback job, but his athletic ability will make him a prime candidate to be a situational player as a rookie during the regular season. Milroe is expected to see extended action on Thursday night against the Raiders. His dual-threat ability makes him a threat to rack up DFS points as a runner, especially at this point in the preseason when passing games are still gelling and working on timing issues. If he ends up playing half of the game or more as expected, Milroe is a prime candidate to be the top-scoring quarterback on the slate. Part of Kaylor's Thursday NFL DFS strategy includes Colts running back DJ Giddens. The former Kansas State standout was one of the top running backs in college football in 2024. In his final two college seasons, Giddens rushed for 2,569 yards and 17 touchdowns, and he caught 50 passes for 581 yards and four scores. Giddens was widely considered to be one of the biggest steals of the 2025 Draft, and he has already been generating a ton of buzz during Indianapolis' training camp. With Jonathan Taylor and Tyler Goodson both expected to play minimally on Thursday, there should be ample opportunity for Giddens to shine in an extended role against the Ravens.

Fantasy football 2025: Top 10 league-winners,"The term ""league-winner"" gets thrown around in fantasy football all the time. But what is a league-winner? Often, it's a player who greatly outperforms his draft cost -- a late-round pick who breaks out to become an every-week starter, for example. It's also possible for a first-round pick to be a league-winner, but such a player must be historically good. Every year, there are players who take their games to the next level and completely change fantasy leagues. Don't you wish you knew about these guys before they broke out? I've got you. Here are my top league-winner candidates heading into the 2025 season. NOTE: Average draft position (ADP) is via FantasyPros' consensus rankings. The Bears’ top two receivers are in a prime position for league-winner status this season. Not only did Chicago make the premier play-caller upgrade of the offseason with the hiring of Ben Johnson, it also rebuilt the interior of the offensive line. A more creative passing attack under Johnson and more time in the pocket for Caleb Williams should lead to great results. We already know Moore can perform as a WR1 in fantasy, though last year he was limited by usage, leading to a career-low in air yards per target. Odunze didn’t hit as a rookie in 2024, but that was largely because he had the lowest rate of catchable targets and second-most unrealized air yards in the league, per NFL Research. Odunze has received praise from Johnson in camp, and it looks like he’ll operate as the Bears’ X receiver. With Moore currently the WR21 and Odunze the WR37 in ADP, there is a clear opportunity for both players to exceed expectations on the fantasy front -- especially Moore, who I rank much closer to a fantasy WR1 due to his versatility. Walker has always returned solid RB2 value, but the fantasy community has been waiting for him to produce a breakout RB1 season. He could be in position to feast in the Seahawks' new scheme -- a welcome sight for Walker after the Seahawks ranked in the bottom five in run play percentage in each of the last two seasons. New OC Klint Kubiak operates a heavy outside-zone run scheme, which should allow Walker to put up more chunk plays in Year 4. Last season under Kubiak, the Saints ran outside zone at the third-highest rate in the NFL (Seattle was 22nd). Walker, a solid pass-catching option for Sam Darnold, has yet to play a full regular season, but if he can stay healthy, he should outperform his current RB15 standing. The Lions offense was fantastic for years under Ben Johnson, but one thing it didn’t do often enough was throw the ball deep. In fact, only the Dolphins threw the deep ball at a lower rate in 2024, and in 2023, the Lions did so at the lowest rate in the NFL. New OC John Morton joined the Lions this offseason from Denver, where he spent the last two years as passing game coordinator under Sean Payton. The Broncos ranked 12th and third, respectively, in deep pass percentage over the past two seasons, per PFF. Implementing more deep shots would bode very well for Williams, who picked up 20-plus yards on the 28 percent of his receptions last season, the fifth-highest rate in the NFL. He also finished in the top three in fantasy points per target, yards per target and yards per catch among wide receivers. Williams has flashed breakout potential, but this could be the year he puts it all together. This season feels like the year of the rookie running back with several players in line to start from Day 1. The Chargers’ first-round pick is a very physical runner who has good wiggle for his size (6-foot, 220 pounds). He has the ability to carry the team’s rushing load on his shoulders and can contribute immediately in the pass game. Jim Harbaugh is known for leaning on the run, as his NFL offenses have only finished outside the top 10 in rush attempts once (11th, 2024). Veteran Najee Harris is missing valuable camp time due to a non-football injury, which helps open the runway for Hampton. And while there won’t likely be many strong fantasy options in the Chargers' offense, Hampton and second-year wideout Ladd McConkey should return early-round value. There are certain qualities I look for in running backs that I believe make them great fantasy football assets. The first is big-play ability. Henderson has blazing speed, and his college tape is littered with explosive runs. The other is pass protecting and receiving abilities. Henderson thrived in both areas at Ohio State, which should lead to him playing in passing situations -- a great way for backs to rack up fantasy points. In addition, with Rhamondre Stevenson a holdover from the old regime, the rookie has a real chance to be the feature back in New England. Not to mention, Mike Vrabel's teams have always been run-heavy in the past, leading me to believe Henderson has league-winning upside in the middle rounds. I labeled Swift the best running back value in fantasy drafts largely because he brings league-winning upside as the lead back in Ben Johnson’s offense. The Lions finished among the top two in RB goal-line carries and touchdowns in all three seasons with Johnson at the helm of the offense, and in each of those years, Detroit’s top two backs combined for more than 90 targets. Swift hauled in 48 receptions on 70 targets with Johnson in Detroit in 2022. Swift’s current ADP of RB21 is an opportunity for value. If you draft him at his floor, he could reward you with RB1 upside in one of the NFL's most fantasy-friendly systems. There are some concerns over how little the Eagles threw the ball last season, as they were one of just three teams to throw on less than 50 percent of their plays, per Team Rankings. That seems unlikely to happen again. But even with the low pass volume, Brown, who missed four games due to injury, was on a 17-game pace for 127 targets, 88 receptions, 1,411 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. Only Ja’Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson topped that receiving yards total, and he would’ve matched rookie Brian Thomas Jr.’s fantasy output. That projected production reflects an average season for Brown as an Eagle, as he topped 1,400 yards in both 2022 and ’23. Still, Brown is projected to be a mid-second-round draft pick. I don’t get it. But don’t pass on the opportunity to get a top-five WR in Round 2. There is a clear-cut top five at the quarterback position, and fantasy managers have to pay up to secure one of them. However, my guy Fields brings the same upside at a much lower cost. Dual-threat QBs are fantasy cheat codes, and the first-year Jet is one of three QBs to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Fields has also put up top-five QB numbers in the past; as Pittsburgh’s starter last season, he was on a 17-game pace for 3,134 passing yards, 14 pass TDs, three INTs, 655 rushing yards and 14 rushing touchdowns. That would equate to about 353 fantasy points, which would have made him QB6. Fields took a step forward as a passer in 2024 because he was asked to focus more on short, high-percentage passes instead of airing the ball out. That’s also what I expect with former Lions passing game coordinator Tanner Engstrand at the controls of the Jets offense. Detroit’s explosive offensive used a high volume of outside runs in 2024, and Fields ranks in the top two among QBs in yards and TDs on such runs over the last three seasons. Lastly, I expect the Jets to operate a version of the Tush Push with Fields under center. It feels as if a career year is on the horizon, and if it is, Fields could finish as a top-five QB -- at a low-end QB1 price. Achane finished as a top-five fantasy back last season and that might just be a launching off point. In the 11 games he played with Tua Tagovailoa last season, Achane averaged 22.6 fantasy points per game, which would have made him the RB1 had Tagovailoa stayed healthy over a full season. No running back picked up more points from receiving production than Achane, as Miami abandoned the deep ball and focused on short, quick throws to get the ball out of Tagovailoa’s hands. Achane also saw 70 percent of the team’s goal-line carries. He’s an explosive player who should continue to see plenty of volume on the ground, through the air and near the end zone. Yet, the potential RB1 overall is projected to go in the second round. Take advantage. Last year, I was called “click bait” for ranking Nabers the best receiver in his draft class. I was then told Nabers would not return top-20 WR value as a rookie after labeling him as a one of the breakout candidates in this space. One year later, everyone loves Nabers! The Giants second-year wideout is a first-round fantasy draft pick, but I’ll take it one step further and say he can return league-winning production. In 2024, Nabers led the NFL in target rate (31 percent) and set a league record for most catches in a season by a rookie receiver (109). He also had the third-most unrealized air yards (875) and ninth-highest rate of uncatchable targets (21 percent), while hauling in just five catches of 20-plus air yards, per Next Gen Stats. Watch his college tape and you’ll quickly realize that this is NOT a Nabers problem. The Giants greatly upgraded their QB room this offseason, signing veterans Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston and drafting Jaxson Dart in the first round. With Wilson in place as QB1, Nabers could very well lead the league in receiving yards. And if things break Nabers' way when it comes to scoring, he could be the WR1 overall in 2025.",2025-08-04,https://www.nfl.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-top-10-league-winners

Head to SportsLine now to see the 2025 Fantasy football draft bible. Top 2025 Fantasy football picks The Fantasy football draft bible features 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, including: Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins: Tagovailoa has been a top-16 quarterback per game in three consecutive seasons, finishing in the top five in passing yards per game each year. The veteran signal caller is now heading into Year 4 in Mike McDaniel's offense, and with top wideouts Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle returning, the stage is set for Tagovailoa to hit the ground running in 2025. ""Tagovailoa finished 13th in Fantasy points per game among regular starters last year, and he consistently scores around 20 points per game when healthy,"" White said. ""With Jonnu Smith gone, Tagovailoa should return to more downfield shots to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, which gives him a solid shot at finishing in the 10-12 range at the position, well ahead of his average draft position."" Jordan Mason, RB, Minnesota Vikings: Mason impressed out of the gate last year with Christian McCaffrey unavailable for the 49ers, rushing for 685 yards on 134 rushing attempts and three scores during the team's first eight games. Boasting a far larger frame at 5-foot-11, 223 pounds, Mason could also be the favorite for short-yardage and goal-line work for the Vikings this season, making him an intriguing Fantasy football sleeper. ""Mason looked great as a complementary player in his first two seasons in San Francisco but was dominant as the team's lead back in the first half of 2024, pacing to a 1,620-yard season over the first seven weeks while suffering a shoulder injury late in that stretch,"" White noted. ""Aaron Jones set a career high for rushing yards and a career low in yards per attempt last year, and he turns 31 in December. If Jones starts to show his age or gets banged up at any point, Mason could run away with the RB1 job and become a top-10 Fantasy asset once again.""

The Best and Worst Fantasy Football Draft Spots for 2025,"Every year, fantasy football managers argue over one question perhaps more than any other: If you could choose your draft slot, which one should you take? It might seem like a small detail. After all, we all have access to the same player pool. But the draft slot you choose has a ripple effect. It shapes how your roster is constructed and what kinds of opportunities you’ll have for value throughout the draft. In full PPR leagues, especially those with 12 teams, the math changes depending on where you draft. Some slots provide clear advantages in consistency and draft control, while others force you to adapt to positional runs and tier cliffs. Multiple studies of win-rate data from high-stakes leagues like the FFPC show that early picks carry a measurable edge. Over the past five years, teams drafting from the first three slots post win rates 20-30% higher than those drafting in the middle. This is partly because the top-tier players in fantasy often have massive gaps in projected production over the next tier. In PPR leagues, the drop from WR3 to WR7 or RB4 to RB8 can be as much as 40-60 points across the season. Snake draft math also plays a role. While picks at the ends of rounds come with longer wait times, they offer control. A manager picking at 1.01 or 1.12 can dictate the flow of the draft by initiating runs or grabbing back-to-back players from the same tier. Mid-round drafters rarely get this advantage and are often forced to react, not plan. So, what’s the optimal draft slot in a 12-team fantasy football league in 2025? Here’s our ranking of every spot, 1 through 12, based on overall roster-building flexibility, tier access, and structural advantages over the course of the draft. You get your choice of the top player on the board, and in 2025, that edge is just as big as ever. The positional anchor you land here provides unmatched weekly scoring stability and opens the door for massive point-per-game advantages. You also control the board in every even-numbered round. While the long wait between picks can be painful, the reward at the top outweighs the risk. You still get access to one of the two premier fantasy anchors. That’s a big deal when tier breaks start hitting hard midway through the second round. This slot also gives you strong flexibility in Rounds 2 and 3. You’re early enough to control your build but far enough back to avoid the temptation of overreaching at the turn. This is the last guaranteed shot at the top tier of elite fantasy producers. If the first two managers go RB-WR or vice versa, you’re walking away with a cornerstone. Your second- and third-round picks allow for strong team balance, and the flow of the board sets up well for value in the middle rounds. The turn picks often get dismissed because of the long wait between turns, but 2025 offers great value at the back end. There’s tremendous depth in the early second round, meaning you can double-tap a WR-WR start or land a premium RB and top WR without sacrificing structure. Having two picks close together also lets you plan mini-runs before they happen. Many of the benefits of 1.12 still apply here, but you lose the flexibility of controlling the turn. You may find yourself having to reach slightly to secure your guys. Still, this slot allows for smart team builds, and the Round 2 talent pool is rich enough to build around. In past years, this spot might’ve been ideal. But there’s an argument that we already see a tier drop here in 2025. You’re now selecting at the beginning of a larger positional plateau. While your team can still be strong, you’re no longer guaranteed a true game-breaking asset. The value here depends heavily on Round 2 decisions. You’re close to the turn but don’t quite control it. This means you often miss on key pairings or positional value. You’ll also feel the squeeze in the third and fifth rounds, where players tend to dry up fast. That said, some creative builds can still come together here if you’re willing to go off script. This is a pure middle slot. You’re always in the middle of every positional run, often reacting instead of dictating. You do get access to players who just missed the top tier, but the gap between your picks can put you in a tight spot if you aren’t aggressive. Similar to 1.05, you’re trapped in no-man’s land, not quite early enough to land a superstar, and not quite late enough to control value swings. You’ll need to be sharp and nimble in the middle rounds, where the board is least predictable from this spot. While this isn’t the worst slot, it lacks identity. Your first-round pick is rarely elite, and by the time you’re back on the clock in Round 2, the best combinations are off the board. The best way to succeed here is to zig when others zag and embrace nontraditional builds. You’re too late to get a Tier 1 anchor, and too early to take advantage of second-round slip-ups. It’s easy to get stuck reaching to complete positional needs. Unless you hit on a breakout or two, the odds are against you here. This is the toughest slot to draft from in 2025. You’re caught just behind the optimal late-first and early-second pocket, and too far from the turn to capitalize on flow. Every pick feels like you’re chasing what just happened rather than shaping what’s about to come. 1. 1.01 – You get the best player on the board and strong control at the 2.10/3.01 turn, where premium pairings are still available in 10-team formats. Smaller leagues amplify the value of top-tier players. 2. 1.02 – You’re still landing a game-changing anchor and can double up with elite WR-RB combos at the 2/3 turn. 3. 1.10 – The last pick in Round 1 gives you control of the turn. With more depth in 10-team leagues, the 1.10/2.01 combo is loaded with upside. 4. 1.03 – Slightly behind 1.01 and 1.02 in terms of anchor value, but early enough to benefit from player drop-offs in the third and fifth rounds. 5. 1.09 – You don’t control the turn, but you’re close enough to secure strong stacks or positional builds with a mini-run in mind. 6. 1.04 – This is where the first round starts to flatten. You’ll likely land a low-end Tier 1 player and need to be sharp in Rounds 2 and 3. 7. 1.08 – You’ll find value in early second-round talent but may miss on the last elite options. Not bad, but a bit reactive. 8. 1.05 – Right in the middle of every round. Consistent but predictable. You’ll have to reach occasionally and rely on hitting value mid-draft. 9. 1.06 – Similar to 1.05 but with slightly worse odds of a top-three faller. No-man’s-land when it comes to dictating the draft. 10. 1.07 – Easily the most difficult spot to manage. You miss on elite early talent and have minimal control of runs on either side. Everything feels one step behind. There’s no such thing as a perfect draft slot, only the ability to recognize its strengths and build accordingly. That said, in 2025, the top of the board is as valuable as it’s been in years. If given the chance, take the 1.01 or 1.02 and don’t look back. You’ll be giving yourself the best possible foundation for a championship run. If you’re drafting from the middle, prepare to pivot often and attack value wherever it presents itself. And if you land on the turn, lean into roster structure. The board might not be perfect, but your execution can be.",2025-06-06T16:24:31+00:00,https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/the-best-and-worst-draft-spots-for-2025
Who should be No. 1 pick in fantasy football? Ranking 5 best options,"Who should be No. 1 pick in fantasy football? Ranking 5 best options In the actual NFL draft, NFL teams always want the No. 1 overall pick. In fantasy football drafts, the desire of fantasy managers varies. Some prefer to have the top selection, as it gives them their preferred target atop the draft. Others would rather draft near the end of the snake and get an earlier pick in the second round. As such, the No. 1 overall fantasy pick can be viewed as either a blessing or a curse. But either way, fantasy managers need to make sure they get the pick right. If they don't, their roster depth will suffer as a result. Who are the best options for the top fantasy selection this season? Below is a look at the only five players fantasy football managers should consider taking atop the draft, starting with a running back who was a league-winner for many last season. 2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall No. 1 pick options in fantasy football 1. Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles Barkley was the top fantasy running back last year as he generated just the ninth 2,000-yard rushing season in NFL history. He figures to once again be a highly productive runner after averaging 3.8 yards before contact per carry — a whopping 0.5 yards better than any other running back — behind a stellar Philadelphia offensive line. The only concern with Barkley? He had a league-high 378 touches during the regular season and added another 104 to his ledger in the postseason. Since 2010, running backs with at least 337 touches in a season have seen an average decline of 113.9 PPR points, and 3.9 fewer PPR points per game, the following season. 2. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals Chase won the receiving Triple Crown in 2024, leading the league in catches (127), yards (1,708) and touchdowns (17). He could certainly do it again, given the chemistry he has shown with long-time teammate Joe Burrow and the Bengals' high-volume passing attack. Receiver production is generally more consistent year-to-year than running back production, so few would fault anyone for taking Chase No. 1 overall, especially in PPR leagues. But in half-PPR or standard formats, it is difficult to pass on a high-end running back given how quickly top-tier talents at the position come off the board in snake drafts. 3. Bijan Robinson, RB, Atlanta Falcons Only two running backs had more catches than Robinson's 61 in 2024: De'Von Achane (78) and Alvin Kamara (68). That gives Robinson one of the highest PPR floors among fantasy running backs, and his on-the-ground production (1,456 yards, 14 touchdowns) is nothing to sneeze at, either. Like Barkley, Robinson surpassed the dreaded 337-touch mark in 2024 with 365. Robinson, 23, is much younger than the 28-year-old Barkley, which might aid him in avoiding a decline. However, he also plays in a more volatile offense that will be entrusting second-year QB Michael Penix Jr. as a full-time starter for the first time. 4. Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions Gibbs showed fantasy managers his potential as a workhorse over the final three weeks of the 2024 NFL season. With David Montgomery out, Gibbs averaged 25.7 touches and 162.3 total yards per game while scoring six total touchdowns. While Gibbs' ceiling is that of the No. 1 overall fantasy running back, Montgomery still figures to eat into his workload. Montgomery's size (5-11, 224 pounds) will likely make him Dan Campbell's preferred goal-line option. That might limit Gibbs' upside, but it's worth noting he had the fewest touches (302) among the consensus top-three fantasy running backs for 2025. 5. Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings Jefferson has only once finished worse than the No. 6-rated wide receiver in fantasy. That came in 2023, when he played just 10 games because of a hamstring injury. As long as Jefferson remains healthy, he should be one of the best fantasy football wide receivers, which puts him in the running for the No. 1 overall pick. Still, Jefferson seems more likely to be an early-to-mid first-round selection. The Vikings are breaking in a first-year starter at quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, so any early growing pains could impact Jefferson out of the gate. So, too, could a mild hamstring strain that is keeping Jefferson out of the early stages of Minnesota's training camp.",2025-08-04,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/fantasy/football/2025/08/04/best-fantasy-football-draft-picks/85433239007/
2025 NFL Draft Big Board: Fantasy Football,"With the 2024 NFL Draft in the rearview, it’s time to shift our focus to the rookie draft season. A helpful tool in this process is to understand the state of the college football landscape. Who are the rising stars? And what’s the value of the 2025 picks – are they worth trading for or trading away in our 2024 rookie drafts? Today we will dive into my way-too-early Top-50 Superflex Big Board for 2025 and take a more in-depth look at the top 20. This list showcases nine quarterbacks, 15 running backs, 21 wide receivers and five tight ends and provides a comprehensive overview of the talent pool. In his second season at Texas, Quinn Ewers showcased a significant bounce-back campaign, with his completion percentage rising from 58.1% to 69%. We also saw a jump in his passing production, going from 2,177 to 3,479 yards. Both Xavier Worthy and Adonai Mitchell are on to the NFL, but I expect Ewers to continue his strong play and continue his upward trajectory. His arm is extremely accurate at all levels and he can change up the velocity of his throws. There will be questions about his arm strength and injuries that are piling up, but I foresee him leading what appears to be a relatively weak quarterback class a year from now. After lighting it up at Jackson State in consecutive seasons, Shedeur Sanders continued his success in his first year at Colorado, passing for over 3,000 yards and 27 touchdowns. Sanders is an extremely accurate pocket quarterback who has never seen his completion percentage dip below 69%. Although he doesn’t lean on it, Sanders possesses good mobility to extend plays, but I hope to see some more creativity in 2024. This season, he is getting a few reinforcements in the passing game that should only help his ascension to the top of draft boards. Luther Burden broke out in 2023 with 1,212 receiving yards and nine touchdowns, earning him First Team All-SEC honors. He is operating on a stout frame standing 5-foot-11, 208 pounds, but has next-level speed and acceleration. His ability after the catch to create in various ways has drawn early Deebo Samuel comparisons. In only his second full season at the receiver position, we should expect him to continue his upward trajectory, ultimately earning the top spot among a less-than-stellar WR class. Luther Burden has some wheels pic.twitter.com/a6Pp2kVLOH — Jeremy (@PopesFFH) November 12, 2023 Luther Burden has some wheels pic.twitter.com/a6Pp2kVLOH After two stellar seasons at Ole Miss where Quinshon Judkins amassed 2,725 yards and 31 rushing touchdowns, we will see him in a new uniform, taking his talents to Ohio State. Judkins stands on a sturdy 5-foot-11, 210-pound frame that he imposes on defenders. He also displays breakaway speed and quick feet, making him an extremely effective two-down runner. This season, he will have to overcome a split backfield to produce a third straight 1,000-yard season, but either way, he is the best pure runner in this strong class. It was a disappointing season for Emeka Egbuka, who struggled the most from the change at quarterback, reflected in his production of a mere 515 receiving yards – less than half of his 2022 total. Compounding matters, an ankle injury that resulted in tightrope surgery also dampened the back half of his season. Egbuka pairs his acceleration with incredible routes, allowing him to easily create separation which makes up for his lack of elusivity after the catch. We should see him bounce back this year as the top receiver for the Buckeyes and reestablish himself as a top-flight receiver. We saw flashes of Tetairoa McMillan’s upside as a freshman, but he truly broke out this past year, catching 90 passes for an impressive 1,402 yards and 10 scores. His combination of size and athleticism positions him as one of the most intriguing prospects in his class. In addition, his length and strong hands allow him to dominate contested situations, making him a nightmare matchup for opposing defenders. With more opportunities in 2024, we could see him refine his game even more and emerge as the top receiver. This year, Ollie Gordon exploded onto the scene, producing an NCAA-leading 1,732 rushing yards and 21 rushing touchdowns (second-most). On top of this, we saw him add over 300 receiving yards, giving him an NCAA-leading 2,062 scrimmage yards. Gordon stands on an imposing 6-foot-2, 216-pound frame that he marries with next-level patience and vision, allowing him to produce big plays regularly. With another strong 2024, he could push Quinshon Judkins for the top back in the class. Former Pac-12 Freshman of the Year (2022), Damien Martinez is dawning new threads this year after producing over 1,000 yards and nine touchdowns rushing for the Beavers in 2023. This 6-foot-2, 232-pound runner will inherit the lead role for the Hurricanes and could see a career-high in carries. His combination of speed and size makes him an effective slasher-style runner who displays elite vision and burst. He has been limited in the passing game, so he may struggle to edge the other top-flight backs in this class if this doesn’t improve. After three years of little-to-no production playing behind Stetson Bennett, Carson Beck exploded for 3,941 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. He has elite ball placement that allows him to dissect defenses, no matter the coverage, at all three levels. Beck has a good feel inside the pocket and is creative in opening up throwing lanes for himself. With more reps under his belt in 2024, there is a future where Beck ascends into the top tier and emerges as the top quarterback. https://twitter.com/popesffh/status/1778052209797726419?s=46&t=qDeP6SF7oM9lBmgv5Epq-Q Omarion Hampton is another thick-framed runner in this class, standing 6-foot, 220 pounds, and runs low to the ground with a tremendous ferocity. He is fresh off a dominant season where he led the ACC with 1,504 rushing yards and 16 rushing touchdowns. His ferocity is complemented by elite burst and creativity in the second level to consistently produce big plays. With Drake Maye no longer in the picture, we should anticipate a lot of Hampton in 2024, as he will have a prominent role in the offense. As many people’s top corner and receiver, Travis Hunter is one of a kind. At 6-foot-1, 185 pounds, he is operating on a lean frame, which is concerning considering it has already cost him some time. In his first year with the Buffaloes, he produced 721 receiving yards and five touchdowns. Hunter has strong hands and displays comfort catching outside his frame, giving him a significant catch radius. If Hunter goes forward as a receiver, we could see him ascend to the top of this list. It was a disappointing 2023 for Evan Stewart, who was hindered by a nagging leg injury which limited him to only eight games. He still managed to produce 514 yards and four touchdowns on just 38 receptions. Even though he lacks prototypical size, standing only 5-foot-10, 170 pounds, Stewart has displayed the ability to win at all three levels leaning on his elite quickness and strong hands. His speed makes him a big-play threat and he is always one touch away from breaking a game open. With the change of scenery, we should expect him to step into the Troy Franklin role – this produced a Ducks single-season receiving record. We have seen a gradual decline in production from TreVeyon Henderson since his explosive freshman year where he amassed over 1,200 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. Injuries have been a significant hindrance, allowing him to appear in only 18 games, with 1,497 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns in that span. With the addition of Quinshon Judkins, Henderson may continue to struggle, but his natural ability in the passing game sets him apart from Judkins and positions him to serve as the third-down back within the offense. His quick burst and exceptional vision in the second level make him a potent threat, capable of delivering game-changing plays with every touch. After two consecutive 1,000-plus rushing yard seasons, Devin Neal surprised many by opting to forgo the draft and return to Kansas. His vision and speed excel in their rushing scheme, but his patience and receiving ability shouldn’t be overlooked. His frame is leaner, standing only 5-foot-11, 208 pounds, but his quickness allows him to be an effective interior runner. He is a potent threat whose speed allows him to produce game-breaking plays with regularity. His size may limit his role at the next level along with his fantasy production. https://twitter.com/popesffh/status/1726062207576760487?s=46&t=qDeP6SF7oM9lBmgv5Epq-Q Tre Harris has continued his upward trajectory since transferring to Ole Miss from Louisiana Tech, setting career-highs in receiving yards with 985. With a prototypical perimeter stature of 6-foot-2, 204 pounds, Harris combines fluidity and quickness in his movements. A precise route-runner, he effortlessly creates separation and possesses the speed to outrun defenders after the catch. Entering his second year at Ole Miss, there’s anticipation that he could surpass the 1,000-yard mark, further elevating his status on draft boards. After three highly productive seasons at Troy, Tez Johnson set career-highs with 86 receptions, 1,182 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns in his debut season at Oregon. He is a precise route-runner who excels in yards after the catch, utilizing his creativity and violent movements to elude defenders. Despite his smaller stature at 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, Johnson is a three-level threat with an impressive catch radius. With Dillon Gabriel joining the team in Eugene, expectations remain high for Johnson’s 2024 performance. Riley Leonard’s sophomore season was stellar, producing over 2,900 passing yards and 20 touchdowns, alongside 699 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. In 2023, he faced challenges, including injuries, limiting him to just seven games with 1,102 passing yards and three touchdowns. Standing at 6-foot-4, 205 pounds, Leonard possesses prototypical size, a strong arm and dual-threat capabilities. With his transfer to Notre Dame this year, expectations are high for him to rebound and emerge as one of the top-tier quarterbacks. Riley Leonard adds his bid for best placement of the night, some impressive QB play tonight from the top names in this class. pic.twitter.com/214EEQbQkK — Jeremy (@PopesFFH) October 22, 2023 Riley Leonard adds his bid for best placement of the night, some impressive QB play tonight from the top names in this class. pic.twitter.com/214EEQbQkK Despite loads of talent, Dane Key has struggled to produce at a high level, with only a career-high of 636 receiving yards and six touchdowns. With a prototypical stature, standing 6-foot-3 195 pounds, Key pairs size with speed and fluidity to beat defenders at all levels. He has strong hands and a huge catch radius, making him an effective red-zone threat. If we can see him refine his game and put it all together, he is a star in the making. Trevor Etienne has struggled to emerge from a split backfield while at Florida, hindering his high-end production, amassing only 1,710 scrimmage yards in two years. Despite this, there have been flashes of game-breaking big plays sprinkled in there, in large part due to his tremendous burst and speed. Standing on a short but thick 5-foot-9, 208-pound frame allows him to bounce off defenders easily. Playing behind one of the best offensive lines in college football this year at Georgia should help him take the next step as a runner and hopefully get him his first 1,000-yard rushing season. We saw an explosion from Colston Loveland this past season where he collected 649 yards and four touchdowns for the Wolverines. Loveland is extremely athletic, considering he stands on a strong but lanky 6-foot-5, 245-pound frame. In addition, he possesses the speed to threaten defenders down the seam and is savvy enough to create separation against man coverage. He will need to add some strength to his frame to become a force in the blocking game or else he could be relegated to a big slot role at the next level, which may limit his opportunities.",2024-05-06T13:05:30+00:00,https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/fantasy-football-2025-big-board
"2025 fantasy football rankings: Quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end ranks","2025 fantasy football rankings: Quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end ranks There's still plenty of time to prepare for your fantasy draft. But if you want to compete with the best, now is the time to start getting ready. Fantasy football seems to get harder and harder every year. With teams sharing backfields, injuries, and changes to the game, it seems the NFL has new wrinkles for fans to figure out every year.

Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Breakouts by proven NFL model that nailed Jayden Daniels' huge rookie season,"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Breakouts by proven NFL model that nailed Jayden Daniels' huge rookie season SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football breakouts for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep Finding a couple of underrated players who can help round out your Fantasy football lineups is almost mandatory if you want to win a championship, so the hunt for 2025 Fantasy football breakouts is on. Managers everywhere are beginning their 2025 Fantasy football draft prep now that preseason games have begun. Fantasy football rookies like Ashton Jeanty, Cam Ward and Travis Hunter are all in line for big roles this year, but if they don't live up to the hype, you could be left with glaring holes in your Fantasy football lineups. With a live-updated set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings, you can find under-the-radar Fantasy football picks capable of outperforming their Fantasy football ADP. Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels would comfortably outperform his ADP (QB13). The result: Daniels threw for 3,568 yards and 25 touchdowns with only nine interceptions and added 891 rushing yards with six more scores on the ground to take home NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He finished as QB5 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and was a great addition to Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman. Coleman caught just 29 passes as a rookie but showed big-play ability, ranking third in yards per catch among receivers with 50+ targets. Coleman did enough in terms of production that the Bills didn't make it a priority to add to the pass-catching group this offseason. He's a former first-round pick who now has a year of experience under his belt and Josh Allen throwing him the football, making him a prime candidate to have a breakout season. SportsLine's model is projecting Coleman to outperform fellow receivers like Stefon Diggs, Cooper Kupp and Michael Pittman, identifying him as one of the top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts to target on draft day. Another potential breakout that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy. After missing the 2024 season with a torn meniscus, McCarthy is expected to open the season as the QB1 for the Vikings. McCarthy is in a great situation under coach Kevin O'Connell, throwing passes to Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson while playing behind one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. McCarthy also offers more running ability than Sam Darnold, who threw for a career-high 4,319 yards and 35 touchdowns in Minnesota during the 2024 regular season. According to SportsLine's model, McCarthy is expected to outperform QBs like Darnold, Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson this season, making him a breakout candidate in 2025. See which other Fantasy football breakouts 2025 to pick here. How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a rookie running back to make an immediate impact. The model ranks this player as a top-10 option ahead of more established stars like Christian McCaffrey and Bucky Irving. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine. So which 2025 Fantasy Football breakouts should you target, and which RB shocks the NFL with a top-10 performance?

20 Fantasy Football Sleepers Experts Draft (2025),"Finding value late in fantasy football drafts can be the difference between a good team and a championship contender. That’s why we asked our Featured Pros – a trusted collection of industry-leading fantasy football analysts – to share their favorite late-round draft steals for the 2025 season. Specifically, we wanted to know: Which one running back and one wide receiver outside the top 45 in half-PPR ADP do you plan to target in all drafts and why? Whether you’re looking to stash upside on your bench or hit big with a sleeper pick, this expert-driven list of fantasy football sleepers at RB and WR is loaded with insights to help you win your draft in the later rounds. Fantasy Football Sleepers Which one RB outside the top 45 in half-PPR RB ADP do you plan to target in all drafts as a late-round fantasy football sleeper and why? Isaac Guerendo (RB – SF) “Well, another injury to Christian McCaffrey in 2025 would add another wrinkle to things, wouldn’t it? Now, who stands to benefit if CMC cannot stay healthy? Issac Guerendo. Guerendo is now the clear handcuff to McCaffrey with Jordan Mason now in Minnesota, and any McCaffrey injury will have Guerendo as a minimum top-20 weekly play. Last season, when Guerendo was the guy in the backfield for the 49ers (without Mason or McCaffrey), he finished no less than the RB25 in weekly scoring and finished as high as the RB2. For any CMC managers, Guerendo is a must-have. For any non-CMC managers, Guerendo has league winner written all over him and is one of the best lottery tickets in fantasy for 2025.” – Ed Birdsall (Talking Points Sports) “Isaac Guerendo fits the suit nicely, slotted behind an aging Christian McCaffrey and tied to a Kyle Shanahan offense. Of course, the Niners likely have a below-average offensive line, but Shanahan has found a way around that before. When San Francisco traded Justin Mason (a nice sleeper himself, though he’s too pricy for today’s assignment), it was a quiet endorsement for Guerendo.” – Scott Pianowski (Yahoo! Sports) “We’ve already seen the 49ers make stars out of relative unknowns at running back. Isaac Guerendo is next in line should something happen to Christian McCaffrey. And we’ve already seen something happen to McCaffrey. It’s unlikely Guerendo will stay this low, as he’s the must-have handcuff of a top-ranked stud running back, so snag him if he’s available anywhere beyond Round 10.” – Matt De Lima (Athlon Sports) Braelon Allen (RB – NYJ) “The Jets want to run the football in 2025 with a stable of RBs. And that means we could see a lot of second-year RB, Braelon Allen. Allen earned a role as an extremely young rookie last season (20 years old), despite Breece Hall being healthy to start the season. Allen is a no-nonsense rusher and could very much be the “David Montgomery” in the Jets’ offense under new OC Tanner Engstrand (formerly of the Lions). Allen converted on 11 of his 12 carries on 3rd-1 last year, a 91.7% rate that was not only the best among all NFL backs in 2024 but the best by any back from 2021-24 (Jets.com). With Justin Fields under center, expect Allen to take full advantage of wide-open rushing lanes.” – Andrew Erickson (FantasyPros) Jaydon Blue (RB – DAL) “Jaydon Blue is a high-upside late-round steal in fantasy drafts, particularly in half-PPR formats, due to his elite speed, pass-catching ability, and potential opportunity in Dallas’ backfield. Despite being a fifth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Blue turned heads at Texas’ Pro Day, running a 4.25 and 4.28 40-yard dash. Now, he’s already stealing the show in Cowboys OTAs, impressing coaches and analysts with his explosiveness and versatility. With Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders ahead of him on the depth chart, he still appears in line to cement himself as the RB1 in Dallas. Dallas has a strong history of producing fantasy-relevant running backs, and Blue could carve out a valuable role, particularly in passing-down situations. If his speed translates to the field and he earns increased touches, he has the potential to be a league-winning late-round pick.” – Lawrence Iacona (Gridiron Experts) Jaylen Wright (RB – MIA) “I still have faith in Jaylen Wright in Miami. I’ve said many times that De’Von Achane is a trade-away target due to his price of dynasty RB5 in ECR. Achane’s RB7 ADP is still a little high and makes me worried. Enter the much cheaper Dolphins’ RB in Wright as a much less risky option. RB53 and 173 overall make him someone I’d gladly want to stash on my bench. His 2024 stats weren’t great, but what we saw was worth another look this year.” – Andrew Hall (FantasyPros) “Here’s a Ringo summer special: buy one sleeper, get the second one absolutely free. Jaylen Wright takes over for Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson in the Dolphins’ RBBC, both of whom are no longer in Miami. Wright is an explosive threat to score every time he touches the rock. And when it comes to New York, Sports Illustrated insider Albert Breer thinks that Braelon Allen’s role in the Jets’ offense could be “pretty significant” in 2025. Both Wright and Allen already have part-time roles in RBBCs, but if anything happens to the other part of their respective committees (De’Von Achane or Breece Hall), then their fantasy potential opens up like the Red Sea.” – Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts) “There was some excitement for Jaylen Wright this time last year when the Dolphins gave up a future 3rd to move up and draft him in the 4th round, but his season was a bit disappointing. However, Raheem Mostert is out of the picture now, and coach McDaniel loves using 2 RBs in his system. This offense can support another fantasy-relevant RB alongside De’Von Achane; it’s just a matter of who between Wright and newcomers Alexander Mattison and Ollie Gordon II. I’m going to bank on the speedster in Wright to fill that role and make a huge leap in his sophomore year.” – Joey Meinerding (Fantasy Dink) Brashard Smith (RB – KC) “We’ll see how training camp pans out, but if he’s heavily involved in the backfield rotation early, as I expect, I’ll be drafting Brashard Smith everywhere this season as a final-round pick. The Chiefs are no strangers to allowing a seventh-round running back a legit shot at starting (hi, Isiah Pacheco), so we can’t say that Smith has zero shot. I am enamored with Smith’s receiving ability as a converted wide receiver, his lightning quickness, and his possible upside as a rusher for a player who is still getting acclimated to the position. Last year, Smith ranked 34th in breakaway percentage, second in receiving grade, and 22nd in yards per route run (per PFF). Smith’s skill set is different from every other back in this depth chart. He could easily carve out a stand-alone role as Kansas City’s new Jerick McKinnon, with the upside to be their every-down back if Pacheco proves unable to stay healthy again.” – Derek Brown (FantasyPros) Elijah Mitchell (RB – KC) “This isn’t the safest of answers, but I’ll take some chances on Elijah Mitchell/Brashard Smith in case one of them becomes the next shiny toy in the Chiefs’ backfield. Isaiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt have had their time in the sun, to be sure, but they’ve also had plenty of time on the sidelines due to injuries. Mitchell and Smith are both worth late-round dart throws in what is still a dynamic Chiefs’ offense. Whoever wins the RB3 battle is the one to keep an eye on heading into the new season.” – Zach Greubel (Gridiron Experts) MarShawn Lloyd (RB – GB) “MarShawn Lloyd is RB59 by ADP and is a screaming value. He had some of the worst luck ever in his rookie season, but the Packers completely ignored the RB class in 2025 after spending Day 2 capital on Lloyd in the 2024 draft. The Packers, and head coach Matt LaFleur, are outspoken about how much they want to run a committee approach and were forced into Josh Jacobs seeing all those touches in 2024. I expect Lloyd to be featured in a pass-catching/explosive RB 1B role behind Jacobs, with the size to be a great handcuff if the aging Jacobs were to miss time.” – Justin Frye (Pro Football Network) Ray Davis (RB – BUF) “Ray Davis (RB47 in the rankings) is one of my favorite late-round running back draft targets. Buffalo led the NFL with 32 rushing touchdowns last season. James Cook led the league with 16 rushing touchdowns, while Josh Allen had 12 scores. However, Davis also had an impact on the ground, totaling three rushing touchdowns. More importantly, he stood out when Cook missed time due to an injury. The former Kentucky star was outstanding in the one game Cook missed with an injury last year. Davis finished Week 6 as the RB14, totaling 23 touches for 152 scrimmage yards and 16.7 half-point PPR fantasy points despite not scoring a touchdown. The second-year pro is a solid flex option with significant upside if Cook’s contract situation leads to a holdout.” – Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros) “Ray Davis profiles as one of the top late-round steals for 2025. When James Cook missed Week 6 last season, Davis proved he could be a three-down workhorse, racking up 23 touches for 152 total yards. In games where he saw at least a 50% snap share, he averaged over 100 total yards, while ranking in the top five in missed tackles forced per attempt. He also contributed as a pass-catcher, recording 17 receptions and two touchdowns in a limited role. With Cook’s contract situation up in the air and Davis’ ADP sitting outside the top 100, he’s a high-upside lottery ticket that I’ll be targeting everywhere.” – James Emrick-Wilson (Armchair Scouting) Austin Ekeler (RB – WAS) “Austin Ekeler is being left for dead (RB48) in early ECR, even though he was productive when healthy last year and is playing in an exciting, up-and-coming offense. Ekeler scored double-digit PPR points in 8-of-12 games last season and finished RB31 in fantasy points per game. When Brian Robinson Jr. missed a pair of midseason games with a hamstring injury, Ekeler had 134 yards from scrimmage and scored three touchdowns in those two contests. Two of those TDs came against a tough Pittsburgh defense. I’m not expecting a return to the high-end RB1 days for the 30-year-old Ekeler, but I think he’s a value in the later rounds.” – Pat Fitzmaurice (FantasyPros) Audric Estime (RB – DEN) “A player that stands out to me who has legit upside is Audric Estime. In a press conference, head coach Sean Payton said, “He’s a back that requires enough touches. He’s gonna get those opportunities.” Alvin Kamara was selected only 7 picks after RJ Harvey in the 2017 NFL Draft. Kamara and Mark Ingram co-existed in New Orleans, and I think that Estime and Harvey could be Payton’s new Kamara and Ingram. Kamara was the RB4 in FPPG his rookie season, while Ingram was the RB8. Harvey is a great pass-catching RB, just like Kamara, and Estime is a thumper who will run through the defense. Estime had 13 MTF on only 76 rushing attempts last season.” – Nick Penticoff (Fantasy Football Astronauts) Kendre Miller (RB – NO) “For me, it’s target Kendre Miller of the Saints, whom I plan to target outside the top 45 RBs. His current ADP is RB85 and 288th overall, meaning you can use your last pick on him. Miller showed flashes of explosiveness in limited action last season, and with potential changes in the Saints’ backfield as veteran Alvin Kamara nears the age cliff, he could see a significant role. His pass-catching ability fits well in half-PPR formats, offering value if he secures more touches. Kendre Miller’s athleticism and receiving skills make him a breakout candidate if he earns a larger share of the Saints’ backfield in 2025. With Alvin Kamara’s contract situation uncertain and Devin Neal as the only other competition, Miller could capitalize on increased opportunities. His low ADP makes him a high-reward pick with minimal risk in late rounds.” – Aaron St Denis (Fantasy Sports Advice Network) Tyler Allgeier (RB – ATL) “Tyler Allgeier remains one of the NFL’s most efficient and underrated complementary backs. In 2024, he posted a broken tackle rate of 0.26 per carry (top 12 among RBs with at least 100 carries), averaged 3.1 yards after contact per attempt, averaged 4.7 YPC (11th among running backs with at least 100 carries), a 100% catch rate, and recorded a positive run on 83.2% of his carries. While Bijan Robinson is the clear lead in Atlanta, Allgeier carved out a valuable role in short-yardage and red zone situations, logging 31 carries inside the 10-yard line and converting 9 of them into touchdowns. His north-south efficiency, vision between the tackles, and low fumble rate (0.4%) make him a reliable asset providing weekly contributions and an immediate RB1 should anything happen to Bijan.” – Avery Thrasher (The Branded Sports) Which one WR outside the top 55 in half-PPR WR ADP do you plan to target in all drafts as a late-round fantasy football sleeper and why? Kyle Williams (WR – NE) “Even though the Patriots did sign Stefon Diggs to a one-year deal this offseason, there are still massive questions as to who will emerge as the go-to target for Drake Maye. Enter Kyle Williams. The Patriots spent a third-round selection on the former Washington State product, and he comes to New England with the reputation of a burner who runs slick routes and is a YAC (yards after catch) monster. In a new regime, Williams, the current WR63 in half-PPR ADP, has every chance to emerge quickly as the main target for Drake Maye and even overtake Stefon Diggs as the number one target in this New England offense.” – Ed Birdsall (Talking Points Sports) “Rookie receivers are rarely good bets, and New England’s recent history of WR drafting is an unmitigated disaster. But maybe Kyle Williams is ready to break these rules and trends. Williams has the ability to play all over the formation, and perhaps he’s the ideal young talent to grow together with second-year QB Drake Maye. Don’t overlook the hiring of return OC Josh McDaniels — he’s one of those coaches who’s miscast as a head coach but a home run as a play designer. You might not even have to draft Williams; be ready to pounce if he’s available around Halloween, mindful of how first-year skill players often ascend in the second half of their debut season.” – Scott Pianowski (Yahoo! Sports) “When selecting a flyer at wide receiver, I’m looking for two types: a relative unknown with high ceiling or a player returning from injury who showed out in flashes at some point. The latter perfectly describes New Orleans’ Rashid Shaheed, but he doesn’t quite qualify as he’s just inside the top 55. However, the former describes New England’s Kyle Williams, who could face a path of least resistance to a starting job in the Patriots’ patched-together WR room.” – Matt De Lima (Athlon Sports) “There are so many good WR options to pick outside the top 55, but one feels like the clearest path to being the top pass game option, and that’s Patriots rookie Kyle Williams. Stefon Diggs is coming back from a serious knee issue at an advanced age and partying on boats rather than attending workouts. Meanwhile, Williams has a highlight or daily at OTAs showing him getting behind whoever is in coverage. Williams can be used underneath or deep, and with an ascending young QB, I expect the young WR to return solid, probably WR3 level value at WR5 prices.” – Justin Frye (Pro Football Network) “If there’s one word to describe Kyle Williams, it’s explosive. Williams plays faster than his 4.40 forty time from the combine, which is impressive. And while Kyle probably won’t be a high-volume guy, his calling card is big plays. Remember Paul Revere’s ride…..one if by land, two if by sea, and you’re going to want to see Kyle Williams play. The Drake Maye and Kyle Williams connection should provide plenty of celebratory musket shots for Patriots Nation. Ringo’s comp- Kyle Williams reminds me a little of former Carolina all-pro WR Steve Smith Sr.” – Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts) “I desperately want Kyle Williams and Drake Maye to develop a quick rapport this offseason. Williams was one of the more underrated receiver prospects heading into the 2025 draft. The Patriots concurred, taking him with the 69th overall pick despite having recently signed Stefon Diggs. The Washington State standout has some flashes of a healthy Jaylen Waddle in him in a potentially up-and-coming New England offense.” – Zach Greubel (Gridiron Experts) Marvin Mims Jr. (WR – DEN) “Marvin Mims Jr. flashed major upside in the second half of 2024, averaging 62 receiving yards per game and leading all WRs in yards per route run (3.63) from Week 11 onward. He also posted a strong 28% target rate per route run on the year, ranking 13th in the NFL. Still just 23 years old, Mims is a prime third-year breakout candidate in a Broncos offense looking to grow alongside Bo Nix.” – Andrew Erickson (FantasyPros) “Marvin Mims Jr. (WR59 in the rankings) is my favorite late-round wide receiver draft target. The Broncos’ offense became fantasy-friendly late last season. Courtland Sutton was the only non-quarterback that fantasy players could trust for most of the year. However, Mims started to shine over the final two months. He scored 12.3 or more half-point PPR fantasy points in four of the final seven regular-season games, including at least 18.4 in three outings. Many believed Denver would have made a splashy addition at the wide receiver position this offseason. However, that didn’t happen because of how Mims ended last year. He averaged 6.5 receptions for 77 receiving yards, two touchdowns, and 22.9 fantasy points per game over the final two weeks, making several big-time plays for Bo Nix and the offense. Mims should be a popular third-year breakout candidate.” – Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros) “Marvin Mims Jr. (ECR: WR58). Last year, Mims scored six touchdowns over the Broncos’ last seven regular-season games and averaged 62 yards a game over that stretch. He didn’t play half of the Broncos’ offensive snaps in any of those seven games, yet Mims was WR26 in PPR fantasy points per game over that stretch. Mims averaged 0.72 PPR fantasy points per snap in those games. Top fantasy receiver Ja’Marr Chase averaged 0.38 PPR fantasy points per snap last season. Mims is only 23. If his role doesn’t expand, you can waive him without regret. But Mims has flashed exciting potential, making him a perfect late-round flyer.” – Pat Fitzmaurice (FantasyPros) “Marvin Mims Jr. should be a priority target in all Half-PPR fantasy drafts due to his explosive second-half breakout and elite efficiency. He posted 33 receptions, 451 yards, and 6 touchdowns over the final stretch of 2024, averaging 13.7 yards per catch and ranking fourth among WRs in yards per route run (2.57). Mims also led the league in slot target rate (38.2%) and ranked top-10 in targets per route against man coverage (35%), indicating both volume and versatility. His 131.5 passer rating when targeted underscores the trust he earned from quarterbacks. With a more stable role projected for 2025, Mims is a high-upside, late-round value who could emerge as a weekly flex option with WR2 potential.” – Avery Thrasher (The Branded Sports) Emeka Egbuka (WR – TB) “Emeka Egbuka is a sleeper worth targeting late in drafts, offering immediate upside in Tampa Bay’s evolving offense. Selected No. 19 overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, the former Ohio State standout brings elite route running, natural separation skills, and deep-threat explosiveness, making him a strong fit alongside Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. Numerous OTA highlights show Mayfield looking his way often, displaying strong early chemistry as Egbuka flashes his downfield speed and ability to stretch the defense. With his vertical playmaking and ability to keep defenses honest, Egbuka could carve out a significant role sooner than expected. If his early momentum carries into the season, he could outperform his draft cost and become a valuable late-round fantasy asset.” – Lawrence Iacona (Gridiron Experts) “I’d target Emeka Egbuka of the Buccaneers, ranked outside the top 55 in half-PPR ADP on FantasyPros with an ADP WR54. Egbuka, a 2025 first-round pick, brings polished route-running and reliable hands from Ohio State, where he posted two 1,000-yard seasons. Despite a crowded Buccaneers WR room with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, his slot-ready skill set signals high floor potential. With Evans aging and Godwin’s injury history, Egbuka could see significant targets from Day 1. He’s a low-risk, high-reward late-round pick with WR2 upside.” – Aaron St Denis (Fantasy Sports Advice Network) Jalen McMillan (WR – TB) “Jalen McMillan at WR61 (151 overall) seems like the best steal of the later rounds at WR to me. I get that he’s stuck behind both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, but either one of them could miss time this year and launch McMillan into the starting roster discussion. Not only that, in keeper leagues where the round drafted matters, McMillan and Egbuka could be the two WRs in Tampa next season, adding even more value to his late-round price.” – Andrew Hall (FantasyPros) Jayden Higgins (WR – HOU) “Thank you, ADP. Jayden Higgins sitting at WR56 is a gift that EVERYONE should take advantage of. Higgins should immediately file in as the starting outside receiver opposite Nico Collins. Higgins was an underrated player during the entire draft process after ranking 27th and 16th in yards per route run and first and 18th in receiving grade during his final two collegiate seasons (per PFF). With Tank Dell likely out for the entire 2025 season, Higgins has a clear path to playing time with the talent to produce as a WR3 this season.” – Derek Brown (FantasyPros) Wan’Dale Robinson (WR – NYG) “Wan’Dale Robinson had 140 targets last season, the 10th most in the league. Robinson only had 699 receiving yards and three touchdowns, but there is a good chance he will see 120+ targets again this season. Robinson led the team in red zone targets with 17, so we could see him have more touchdowns. The Giants are basically running it back with their skill position group at wide receiver, which is good news for Robinson. You aren’t going to find someone in his draft range who will see the type of target volume he is in store for this year.” – Nick Penticoff (Fantasy Football Astronauts) Jack Bech (WR – LV) “I’m going to try to draft Jack Bech in all my drafts in those later rounds. He was a great playmaker in TCU last year with second-round draft capital, and the opportunity is there with not much competition in the WR room. In these later rounds, you don’t expect much from these players. So if Bech ends up posting WR2 or WR3 numbers, decisions like this could be the reason you make the playoffs in your league. Take a risk on those rookies who have a clear path to fantasy success like Bech.” – Joey Meinerding (Fantasy Dink) Pat Bryant (WR – DEN) “Pat Bryant is one of my favorite deep fantasy football sleepers heading into 2025 drafts. The Broncos’ third-round rookie posted 54 catches for 984 yards and 10 TDs in his final season at Illinois, showcasing strong hands and red-zone reliability. Head coach Sean Payton compared him to Michael Thomas, hinting at a potential high-volume role in a thin receiver room behind Courtland Sutton. While he lacks elite speed (4.61 40-yard dash), Bryant wins with physicality, route discipline, and quite possibly the strongest hands in the class, traits that fit Payton’s offense perfectly. With a current ADP of WR73, Bryant offers strong late-round value and a realistic path to early playing time.” – James Emrick-Wilson (Armchair Scouting) Subscribe: YouTube | Spotify | Apple Podcasts | iHeart | Castbox | Amazon Music | Podcast Addict | TuneIn",2025-06-20,https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/06/20-fantasy-football-sleepers-experts-draft-2025/?lid=r2d5nkuw9suo
2025 Fantasy Football Rankings With Player Notes | Underdog Network,"The 2025 fantasy football season is approaching, and we're already 50+ drafts in on Underdog Fantasy to prepare for our redraft leagues. More importantly, we're dozens of YouTube videos into our stats vs. film analysis of these players. I've recapped some of our thoughts on the players we've covered in depth, but make sure to watch these videos. Updated on July 24th. ... These Half PPR rankings can be uploaded to Underdog if you save it as a CSV. Sometimes you need to change the capitalization of ""id"" to get the upload to work. ... The 2024 finish seen above are fantasy points over replacement per game (min. 5 games), where the player only gets credit for the half PPR points above the average QB12, RB31, WR31, and TE12 weekly score. For example, if Josh Allen scores 20.3 half PPR points in Week 1 and the average QB12 score is 18.3 points, then he gets +2.0 points for that week.

Fantasy Football Sleepers 2025: Top Must-Draft Players,"Fantasy Football Sleepers 2025 Introduction Fantasy football never stops, and if you want to stay ahead of the competition, you need to be thinking about sleepers before anyone else. In this article, we’re diving deep into the top must-draft fantasy football sleepers for 2025. These are the players flying under the radar now but will be league winners when the season starts. What Defines a Fantasy Football Sleeper? A sleeper is a player who is undervalued by consensus rankings and the general fantasy football community. These players often provide massive return on investment based on their draft position. In 2024, players like Brian Thomas Jr. and Ladd McConkey were sleeper hits—now, we’re looking for the next breakout stars. Top 7 Must-Draft Fantasy Football Sleepers for 2025 1. Bo Nix (QB, Denver Broncos) Bo Nix finished 7th in fantasy points last year, yet he is currently ranked 13th among quarterbacks. The fantasy industry undervalues him simply because he isn’t a consensus favorite. Let’s break down why Nix is a value pick: - Finished 12th in passing yards - Scored 37.2 fantasy points per game - Outperformed Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray, and Justin Herbert Nix could be an incredible mid-round quarterback steal. If you miss out on elite QBs early, he is an excellent target in drafts. I really like the youth talent and upside. He is a special players and could do better than guys like Pat Mahomes, and Justin Herbert again. Don’t sleep on the young man! I would love to see him get more offensive weapons to boost his production too! 2. Bucky Irving (RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers) Despite finishing 13th among running backs, Bucky Irving is ranked 7th. However, his name isn’t as well-known, which means he might slip in drafts. Consider these numbers: - 207 rushing attempts - 1,122 rushing yards - 5.4 yards per carry - 8 touchdowns Tampa Bay phased Rachaad White out as the season progressed, giving Irving more opportunities. Expect an even larger workload in 2025. Bucky is a hard worker and really likes to pound the ball down the field. He has earnd that RB one spot on the Bucs roster 3. Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR, Arizona Cardinals) Last year, Marvin Harrison Jr. was drafted as a second-round fantasy pick. Now, he’s projected as WR30. This is a steal for someone with his upside: - 21st in targets last season (116 total targets) - 62 receptions, 885 yards, 8 touchdowns - Still growing chemistry with Kyler Murray His numbers will increase in 2025 as the Cardinals’ offense continues to develop. He’s an incredible mid-round pick. He is a really good WR and the talent has to shine this season. You also don’t have to pay the 2nd round fantasy draft capital you did last year. I love the value and upside this season. I will look to target him on my rosters in the mid to late rounds of fantasy drafts. 4. Jalen McMillan (WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers) McMillan finished 55th in 2024, yet he’s projected as WR47. If Chris Godwin leaves Tampa Bay, McMillan has a real chance to shine: - 37 receptions on 58 targets - 461 receiving yards - 8 touchdowns If Godwin moves on, McMillan becomes a top-two receiver on the team, making him a high-upside late-round sleeper. 5. Rome Odunze (WR, Chicago Bears) Odunze was a first-round draft pick in 2024, but many fantasy players overlook him due to the crowded receiver room in Chicago. However, with Keenan Allen likely moving on, Odunze could see a significant increase in volume: - 101 targets in 2024 - The Bears’ best long-term receiving option - Caleb Williams’ projected WR1 With Allen’s departure, Odunze could emerge as the primary target, making him a solid sleeper pick. 6. Ashton Jeanty (RB, Rookie – Projected Cowboys or Chargers Pick) Ashton Jeanty is an elite rookie sleeper. Currently ranked RB19, his value will skyrocket when his landing spot is confirmed. Here’s why he’s a must-watch sleeper: - 2,600 total yards in college - 370 total touches - Strong receiving ability - Second in Heisman Trophy voting If Jeanty lands on the Cowboys or Chargers, expect him to be a major fantasy asset. 7. Bonus Sleeper – Veteran Values Older receivers like Stefon Diggs, Deebo Samuel, and Michael Pittman Jr. are all slipping in draft rankings, making them incredible value picks in later rounds. These players still have production upside despite falling out of favor with consensus rankings. I personally don’t like older players, but these guys could be outstanding value in 2025. Final Thoughts The key to dominating your fantasy football league is identifying value before the mainstream rankings catch up. Bo Nix, Bucky Irving, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jalen McMillan, Rome Odunze, and Ashton Jeanty are prime sleepers that could win your league in 2025.",2025-02-18,https://thefantasyfootballcounselor.com/fantasy-football-sleepers-2025-top-must-draft-players/
Matthew Berry's Top 100 Overall Rankings for 2025 fantasy football season,"Now that the NFL draft is behind us and training camps are ramping up we have a much clearer picture of the NFL landscape, it’s time to update and expand my overall rankings from Top 50 to Top 100.

2025 Fantasy Football Rankings: Roundtable Picks & Debates,"Welcome to the first installment of our RotoWire Roundtable 2025 fantasy football rankings. Below are our top-150 composite NFL fantasy rankings from RotoWire football writers Jeff Erickson, Mario Puig, Jim Coventry and Jerry Donabedian. Rankings are based on PPR scoring for single-QB leagues. For each player, we've listed average rank (AV) and median rank (MED), along with each writer's rank. Click on a column to sort. The default order is median ranking. We'll post regular updates this summer to our Roundtable fantasy football rankings. In the meantime, be sure to check out our RotoWire rankings, which can be filtered for standard, PPR, half PPR, dynasty, NFFC, ESPN and Yahoo leagues. We also have customizable rankings, which you can tailor to your specific league requirements, and auction value rankings. And be sure to keep up with the latest fantasy football news. This year's Roundtable has a disagreement right at the top. Three of the four writers ranked Ja'Marr Chase No. 1, but Coventry went against ADP (and RotoWire projections) and put Chase, not second, but third. He has Saquon Barkley in the top spot followed by Bijan Robinson. Coventry was also out of step with the consensus on Jahmyr Gibbs. Erickson and Puig both ranked Gibbs second while Donabedian has him third; Coventry ranked Gibbs seventh. Consensus was hard to find in the top 10.

2025 Fantasy Football Draft Rankings: Fitz’s Early Picks & Predictions,"We’ve entered the fantasy football “offseason.” Those aren’t scare quotes around the word “offseason.” They’re more like mockery quotes, because so many of the people who have embraced fantasy football as a hobby are deeply immersed in it, committed to keeping up with it year-round, even though there won’t be another regular-season game until September. Fantasy football isn’t just a hobby; it’s a compulsion. Check out Fitz’s Early 2025 Fantasy Football Mock Draft And so here I am, rolling out 2025 fantasy football draft rankings roughly seven months before home-league drafts start to take place. Putting together early fantasy draft rankings is always fun, but it’s also a tricky exercise. There’s a lot of projection involved. Rosters are going to change. Some coaching staffs are going to change. Free agency will dramatically alter the fantasy landscape. So will the NFL Draft. And it’s impossible to tell exactly how those events will change things — although we can make some educated guesses. These rankings reintroduce some players who were lost to major injuries in 2024. They also include some players who sustained major injuries late in the 2024 season and may or may not be able to contribute in 2025. These rankings also include rookies. Plugging rookies into such an early set of rankings involves some serious guesswork. Combine testing, draft results and yet-to-be-completed rookie research will make rookie rankings extremely volatile in the coming months. Heck, we don’t even know who all of the early declarers are yet. So, please understand that these are mere placeholder rankings for the rookies, subject to significant changes. But I wanted to include rookies in these early rankings, because early rankings that don’t include rookies are pretty useless. These fantasy football draft rankings are a starting point. I hope you’ll check back frequently as I continue to make adjustments over the months to come. Here are my early 2025 fantasy football draft rankings. 2025 Fantasy Football Draft Rankings Subscribe: YouTube | Spotify | Apple Podcasts | iHeart | Castbox | Amazon Music | Podcast Addict | TuneIn",2025-01-06,https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/01/2025-fantasy-football-draft-rankings-fitzs-early-picks-predictions/
Who should be No. 1 pick in fantasy football? Ranking 5 best options,"Who should be No. 1 pick in fantasy football? Ranking 5 best options In the actual NFL draft, NFL teams always want the No. 1 overall pick. In fantasy football drafts, the desire of fantasy managers varies. Some prefer to have the top selection, as it gives them their preferred target atop the draft. Others would rather draft near the end of the snake and get an earlier pick in the second round. As such, the No. 1 overall fantasy pick can be viewed as either a blessing or a curse. But either way, fantasy managers need to make sure they get the pick right. If they don't, their roster depth will suffer as a result. Who are the best options for the top fantasy selection this season? Below is a look at the only five players fantasy football managers should consider taking atop the draft, starting with a running back who was a league-winner for many last season. 2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall No. 1 pick options in fantasy football 1. Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles Barkley was the top fantasy running back last year as he generated just the ninth 2,000-yard rushing season in NFL history. He figures to once again be a highly productive runner after averaging 3.8 yards before contact per carry — a whopping 0.5 yards better than any other running back — behind a stellar Philadelphia offensive line. The only concern with Barkley? He had a league-high 378 touches during the regular season and added another 104 to his ledger in the postseason. Since 2010, running backs with at least 337 touches in a season have seen an average decline of 113.9 PPR points, and 3.9 fewer PPR points per game, the following season. 2. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals Chase won the receiving Triple Crown in 2024, leading the league in catches (127), yards (1,708) and touchdowns (17). He could certainly do it again, given the chemistry he has shown with long-time teammate Joe Burrow and the Bengals' high-volume passing attack. Receiver production is generally more consistent year-to-year than running back production, so few would fault anyone for taking Chase No. 1 overall, especially in PPR leagues. But in half-PPR or standard formats, it is difficult to pass on a high-end running back given how quickly top-tier talents at the position come off the board in snake drafts. 3. Bijan Robinson, RB, Atlanta Falcons Only two running backs had more catches than Robinson's 61 in 2024: De'Von Achane (78) and Alvin Kamara (68). That gives Robinson one of the highest PPR floors among fantasy running backs, and his on-the-ground production (1,456 yards, 14 touchdowns) is nothing to sneeze at, either. Like Barkley, Robinson surpassed the dreaded 337-touch mark in 2024 with 365. Robinson, 23, is much younger than the 28-year-old Barkley, which might aid him in avoiding a decline. However, he also plays in a more volatile offense that will be entrusting second-year QB Michael Penix Jr. as a full-time starter for the first time. 4. Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions Gibbs showed fantasy managers his potential as a workhorse over the final three weeks of the 2024 NFL season. With David Montgomery out, Gibbs averaged 25.7 touches and 162.3 total yards per game while scoring six total touchdowns. While Gibbs' ceiling is that of the No. 1 overall fantasy running back, Montgomery still figures to eat into his workload. Montgomery's size (5-11, 224 pounds) will likely make him Dan Campbell's preferred goal-line option. That might limit Gibbs' upside, but it's worth noting he had the fewest touches (302) among the consensus top-three fantasy running backs for 2025. 5. Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings Jefferson has only once finished worse than the No. 6-rated wide receiver in fantasy. That came in 2023, when he played just 10 games because of a hamstring injury. As long as Jefferson remains healthy, he should be one of the best fantasy football wide receivers, which puts him in the running for the No. 1 overall pick. Still, Jefferson seems more likely to be an early-to-mid first-round selection. The Vikings are breaking in a first-year starter at quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, so any early growing pains could impact Jefferson out of the gate. So, too, could a mild hamstring strain that is keeping Jefferson out of the early stages of Minnesota's training camp.",2025-08-04,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/fantasy/football/2025/08/04/best-fantasy-football-draft-picks/85433239007/
2025 NFL Draft Big Board: Fantasy Football,"With the 2024 NFL Draft in the rearview, it’s time to shift our focus to the rookie draft season. A helpful tool in this process is to understand the state of the college football landscape. Who are the rising stars? And what’s the value of the 2025 picks – are they worth trading for or trading away in our 2024 rookie drafts? Today we will dive into my way-too-early Top-50 Superflex Big Board for 2025 and take a more in-depth look at the top 20. This list showcases nine quarterbacks, 15 running backs, 21 wide receivers and five tight ends and provides a comprehensive overview of the talent pool. In his second season at Texas, Quinn Ewers showcased a significant bounce-back campaign, with his completion percentage rising from 58.1% to 69%. We also saw a jump in his passing production, going from 2,177 to 3,479 yards. Both Xavier Worthy and Adonai Mitchell are on to the NFL, but I expect Ewers to continue his strong play and continue his upward trajectory. His arm is extremely accurate at all levels and he can change up the velocity of his throws. There will be questions about his arm strength and injuries that are piling up, but I foresee him leading what appears to be a relatively weak quarterback class a year from now. After lighting it up at Jackson State in consecutive seasons, Shedeur Sanders continued his success in his first year at Colorado, passing for over 3,000 yards and 27 touchdowns. Sanders is an extremely accurate pocket quarterback who has never seen his completion percentage dip below 69%. Although he doesn’t lean on it, Sanders possesses good mobility to extend plays, but I hope to see some more creativity in 2024. This season, he is getting a few reinforcements in the passing game that should only help his ascension to the top of draft boards. Luther Burden broke out in 2023 with 1,212 receiving yards and nine touchdowns, earning him First Team All-SEC honors. He is operating on a stout frame standing 5-foot-11, 208 pounds, but has next-level speed and acceleration. His ability after the catch to create in various ways has drawn early Deebo Samuel comparisons. In only his second full season at the receiver position, we should expect him to continue his upward trajectory, ultimately earning the top spot among a less-than-stellar WR class. Luther Burden has some wheels pic.twitter.com/a6Pp2kVLOH — Jeremy (@PopesFFH) November 12, 2023 Luther Burden has some wheels pic.twitter.com/a6Pp2kVLOH After two stellar seasons at Ole Miss where Quinshon Judkins amassed 2,725 yards and 31 rushing touchdowns, we will see him in a new uniform, taking his talents to Ohio State. Judkins stands on a sturdy 5-foot-11, 210-pound frame that he imposes on defenders. He also displays breakaway speed and quick feet, making him an extremely effective two-down runner. This season, he will have to overcome a split backfield to produce a third straight 1,000-yard season, but either way, he is the best pure runner in this strong class. It was a disappointing season for Emeka Egbuka, who struggled the most from the change at quarterback, reflected in his production of a mere 515 receiving yards – less than half of his 2022 total. Compounding matters, an ankle injury that resulted in tightrope surgery also dampened the back half of his season. Egbuka pairs his acceleration with incredible routes, allowing him to easily create separation which makes up for his lack of elusivity after the catch. We should see him bounce back this year as the top receiver for the Buckeyes and reestablish himself as a top-flight receiver. We saw flashes of Tetairoa McMillan’s upside as a freshman, but he truly broke out this past year, catching 90 passes for an impressive 1,402 yards and 10 scores. His combination of size and athleticism positions him as one of the most intriguing prospects in his class. In addition, his length and strong hands allow him to dominate contested situations, making him a nightmare matchup for opposing defenders. With more opportunities in 2024, we could see him refine his game even more and emerge as the top receiver. This year, Ollie Gordon exploded onto the scene, producing an NCAA-leading 1,732 rushing yards and 21 rushing touchdowns (second-most). On top of this, we saw him add over 300 receiving yards, giving him an NCAA-leading 2,062 scrimmage yards. Gordon stands on an imposing 6-foot-2, 216-pound frame that he marries with next-level patience and vision, allowing him to produce big plays regularly. With another strong 2024, he could push Quinshon Judkins for the top back in the class. Former Pac-12 Freshman of the Year (2022), Damien Martinez is dawning new threads this year after producing over 1,000 yards and nine touchdowns rushing for the Beavers in 2023. This 6-foot-2, 232-pound runner will inherit the lead role for the Hurricanes and could see a career-high in carries. His combination of speed and size makes him an effective slasher-style runner who displays elite vision and burst. He has been limited in the passing game, so he may struggle to edge the other top-flight backs in this class if this doesn’t improve. After three years of little-to-no production playing behind Stetson Bennett, Carson Beck exploded for 3,941 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. He has elite ball placement that allows him to dissect defenses, no matter the coverage, at all three levels. Beck has a good feel inside the pocket and is creative in opening up throwing lanes for himself. With more reps under his belt in 2024, there is a future where Beck ascends into the top tier and emerges as the top quarterback. https://twitter.com/popesffh/status/1778052209797726419?s=46&t=qDeP6SF7oM9lBmgv5Epq-Q Omarion Hampton is another thick-framed runner in this class, standing 6-foot, 220 pounds, and runs low to the ground with a tremendous ferocity. He is fresh off a dominant season where he led the ACC with 1,504 rushing yards and 16 rushing touchdowns. His ferocity is complemented by elite burst and creativity in the second level to consistently produce big plays. With Drake Maye no longer in the picture, we should anticipate a lot of Hampton in 2024, as he will have a prominent role in the offense. As many people’s top corner and receiver, Travis Hunter is one of a kind. At 6-foot-1, 185 pounds, he is operating on a lean frame, which is concerning considering it has already cost him some time. In his first year with the Buffaloes, he produced 721 receiving yards and five touchdowns. Hunter has strong hands and displays comfort catching outside his frame, giving him a significant catch radius. If Hunter goes forward as a receiver, we could see him ascend to the top of this list. It was a disappointing 2023 for Evan Stewart, who was hindered by a nagging leg injury which limited him to only eight games. He still managed to produce 514 yards and four touchdowns on just 38 receptions. Even though he lacks prototypical size, standing only 5-foot-10, 170 pounds, Stewart has displayed the ability to win at all three levels leaning on his elite quickness and strong hands. His speed makes him a big-play threat and he is always one touch away from breaking a game open. With the change of scenery, we should expect him to step into the Troy Franklin role – this produced a Ducks single-season receiving record. We have seen a gradual decline in production from TreVeyon Henderson since his explosive freshman year where he amassed over 1,200 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. Injuries have been a significant hindrance, allowing him to appear in only 18 games, with 1,497 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns in that span. With the addition of Quinshon Judkins, Henderson may continue to struggle, but his natural ability in the passing game sets him apart from Judkins and positions him to serve as the third-down back within the offense. His quick burst and exceptional vision in the second level make him a potent threat, capable of delivering game-changing plays with every touch. After two consecutive 1,000-plus rushing yard seasons, Devin Neal surprised many by opting to forgo the draft and return to Kansas. His vision and speed excel in their rushing scheme, but his patience and receiving ability shouldn’t be overlooked. His frame is leaner, standing only 5-foot-11, 208 pounds, but his quickness allows him to be an effective interior runner. He is a potent threat whose speed allows him to produce game-breaking plays with regularity. His size may limit his role at the next level along with his fantasy production. https://twitter.com/popesffh/status/1726062207576760487?s=46&t=qDeP6SF7oM9lBmgv5Epq-Q Tre Harris has continued his upward trajectory since transferring to Ole Miss from Louisiana Tech, setting career-highs in receiving yards with 985. With a prototypical perimeter stature of 6-foot-2, 204 pounds, Harris combines fluidity and quickness in his movements. A precise route-runner, he effortlessly creates separation and possesses the speed to outrun defenders after the catch. Entering his second year at Ole Miss, there’s anticipation that he could surpass the 1,000-yard mark, further elevating his status on draft boards. After three highly productive seasons at Troy, Tez Johnson set career-highs with 86 receptions, 1,182 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns in his debut season at Oregon. He is a precise route-runner who excels in yards after the catch, utilizing his creativity and violent movements to elude defenders. Despite his smaller stature at 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, Johnson is a three-level threat with an impressive catch radius. With Dillon Gabriel joining the team in Eugene, expectations remain high for Johnson’s 2024 performance. Riley Leonard’s sophomore season was stellar, producing over 2,900 passing yards and 20 touchdowns, alongside 699 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. In 2023, he faced challenges, including injuries, limiting him to just seven games with 1,102 passing yards and three touchdowns. Standing at 6-foot-4, 205 pounds, Leonard possesses prototypical size, a strong arm and dual-threat capabilities. With his transfer to Notre Dame this year, expectations are high for him to rebound and emerge as one of the top-tier quarterbacks. Riley Leonard adds his bid for best placement of the night, some impressive QB play tonight from the top names in this class. pic.twitter.com/214EEQbQkK — Jeremy (@PopesFFH) October 22, 2023 Riley Leonard adds his bid for best placement of the night, some impressive QB play tonight from the top names in this class. pic.twitter.com/214EEQbQkK Despite loads of talent, Dane Key has struggled to produce at a high level, with only a career-high of 636 receiving yards and six touchdowns. With a prototypical stature, standing 6-foot-3 195 pounds, Key pairs size with speed and fluidity to beat defenders at all levels. He has strong hands and a huge catch radius, making him an effective red-zone threat. If we can see him refine his game and put it all together, he is a star in the making. Trevor Etienne has struggled to emerge from a split backfield while at Florida, hindering his high-end production, amassing only 1,710 scrimmage yards in two years. Despite this, there have been flashes of game-breaking big plays sprinkled in there, in large part due to his tremendous burst and speed. Standing on a short but thick 5-foot-9, 208-pound frame allows him to bounce off defenders easily. Playing behind one of the best offensive lines in college football this year at Georgia should help him take the next step as a runner and hopefully get him his first 1,000-yard rushing season. We saw an explosion from Colston Loveland this past season where he collected 649 yards and four touchdowns for the Wolverines. Loveland is extremely athletic, considering he stands on a strong but lanky 6-foot-5, 245-pound frame. In addition, he possesses the speed to threaten defenders down the seam and is savvy enough to create separation against man coverage. He will need to add some strength to his frame to become a force in the blocking game or else he could be relegated to a big slot role at the next level, which may limit his opportunities.",2024-05-06T13:05:30+00:00,https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/fantasy-football-2025-big-board
"2025 fantasy football rankings: Quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end ranks","2025 fantasy football rankings: Quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end ranks There's still plenty of time to prepare for your fantasy draft.

Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Breakouts by proven NFL model that nailed Jayden Daniels' huge rookie season,"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Breakouts by proven NFL model that nailed Jayden Daniels' huge rookie season SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football breakouts for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep Finding a couple of underrated players who can help round out your Fantasy football lineups is almost mandatory if you want to win a championship, so the hunt for 2025 Fantasy football breakouts is on. Managers everywhere are beginning their 2025 Fantasy football draft prep now that preseason games have begun. Fantasy football rookies like Ashton Jeanty, Cam Ward and Travis Hunter are all in line for big roles this year, but if they don't live up to the hype, you could be left with glaring holes in your Fantasy football lineups. With a live-updated set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings, you can find under-the-radar Fantasy football picks capable of outperforming their Fantasy football ADP. Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels would comfortably outperform his ADP (QB13). The result: Daniels threw for 3,568 yards and 25 touchdowns with only nine interceptions and added 891 rushing yards with six more scores on the ground to take home NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He finished as QB5 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and was a great addition to Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman. Coleman caught just 29 passes as a rookie but showed big-play ability, ranking third in yards per catch among receivers with 50+ targets. Coleman did enough in terms of production that the Bills didn't make it a priority to add to the pass-catching group this offseason. He's a former first-round pick who now has a year of experience under his belt and Josh Allen throwing him the football, making him a prime candidate to have a breakout season. SportsLine's model is projecting Coleman to outperform fellow receivers like Stefon Diggs, Cooper Kupp and Michael Pittman, identifying him as one of the top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts to target on draft day. Another potential breakout that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy. After missing the 2024 season with a torn meniscus, McCarthy is expected to open the season as the QB1 for the Vikings. McCarthy is in a great situation under coach Kevin O'Connell, throwing passes to Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson while playing behind one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. McCarthy also offers more running ability than Sam Darnold, who threw for a career-high 4,319 yards and 35 touchdowns in Minnesota during the 2024 regular season. According to SportsLine's model, McCarthy is expected to outperform QBs like Darnold, Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson this season, making him a breakout candidate in 2025. See which other Fantasy football breakouts 2025 to pick here. How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a rookie running back to make an immediate impact. The model ranks this player as a top-10 option ahead of more established stars like Christian McCaffrey and Bucky Irving. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine. So which 2025 Fantasy Football breakouts should you target, and which RB shocks the NFL with a top-10 performance?

20 Fantasy Football Sleepers Experts Draft (2025),"Finding value late in fantasy football drafts can be the difference between a good team and a championship contender. That’s why we asked our Featured Pros – a trusted collection of industry-leading fantasy football analysts – to share their favorite late-round draft steals for the 2025 season. Specifically, we wanted to know: Which one running back and one wide receiver outside the top 45 in half-PPR ADP do you plan to target in all drafts and why? Whether you’re looking to stash upside on your bench or hit big with a sleeper pick, this expert-driven list of fantasy football sleepers at RB and WR is loaded with insights to help you win your draft in the later rounds. Fantasy Football Sleepers Which one RB outside the top 45 in half-PPR RB ADP do you plan to target in all drafts as a late-round fantasy football sleeper and why? Isaac Guerendo (RB – SF) “Well, another injury to Christian McCaffrey in 2025 would add another wrinkle to things, wouldn’t it? Now, who stands to benefit if CMC cannot stay healthy? Issac Guerendo. Guerendo is now the clear handcuff to McCaffrey with Jordan Mason now in Minnesota, and any McCaffrey injury will have Guerendo as a minimum top-20 weekly play. Last season, when Guerendo was the guy in the backfield for the 49ers (without Mason or McCaffrey), he finished no less than the RB25 in weekly scoring and finished as high as the RB2. For any CMC managers, Guerendo is a must-have. For any non-CMC managers, Guerendo has league winner written all over him and is one of the best lottery tickets in fantasy for 2025.” – Ed Birdsall (Talking Points Sports) “Isaac Guerendo fits the suit nicely, slotted behind an aging Christian McCaffrey and tied to a Kyle Shanahan offense. Of course, the Niners likely have a below-average offensive line, but Shanahan has found a way around that before. When San Francisco traded Justin Mason (a nice sleeper himself, though he’s too pricy for today’s assignment), it was a quiet endorsement for Guerendo.” – Scott Pianowski (Yahoo! Sports) “We’ve already seen the 49ers make stars out of relative unknowns at running back. Isaac Guerendo is next in line should something happen to Christian McCaffrey. And we’ve already seen something happen to McCaffrey. It’s unlikely Guerendo will stay this low, as he’s the must-have handcuff of a top-ranked stud running back, so snag him if he’s available anywhere beyond Round 10.” – Matt De Lima (Athlon Sports) Braelon Allen (RB – NYJ) “The Jets want to run the football in 2025 with a stable of RBs. And that means we could see a lot of second-year RB, Braelon Allen. Allen earned a role as an extremely young rookie last season (20 years old), despite Breece Hall being healthy to start the season. Allen is a no-nonsense rusher and could very much be the “David Montgomery” in the Jets’ offense under new OC Tanner Engstrand (formerly of the Lions). Allen converted on 11 of his 12 carries on 3rd-1 last year, a 91.7% rate that was not only the best among all NFL backs in 2024 but the best by any back from 2021-24 (Jets.com). With Justin Fields under center, expect Allen to take full advantage of wide-open rushing lanes.” – Andrew Erickson (FantasyPros) Jaydon Blue (RB – DAL) “Jaydon Blue is a high-upside late-round steal in fantasy drafts, particularly in half-PPR formats, due to his elite speed, pass-catching ability, and potential opportunity in Dallas’ backfield. Despite being a fifth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, Blue turned heads at Texas’ Pro Day, running a 4.25 and 4.28 40-yard dash. Now, he’s already stealing the show in Cowboys OTAs, impressing coaches and analysts with his explosiveness and versatility. With Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders ahead of him on the depth chart, he still appears in line to cement himself as the RB1 in Dallas. Dallas has a strong history of producing fantasy-relevant running backs, and Blue could carve out a valuable role, particularly in passing-down situations. If his speed translates to the field and he earns increased touches, he has the potential to be a league-winning late-round pick.” – Lawrence Iacona (Gridiron Experts) Jaylen Wright (RB – MIA) “I still have faith in Jaylen Wright in Miami. I’ve said many times that De’Von Achane is a trade-away target due to his price of dynasty RB5 in ECR. Achane’s RB7 ADP is still a little high and makes me worried. Enter the much cheaper Dolphins’ RB in Wright as a much less risky option. RB53 and 173 overall make him someone I’d gladly want to stash on my bench. His 2024 stats weren’t great, but what we saw was worth another look this year.” – Andrew Hall (FantasyPros) “Here’s a Ringo summer special: buy one sleeper, get the second one absolutely free. Jaylen Wright takes over for Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson in the Dolphins’ RBBC, both of whom are no longer in Miami. Wright is an explosive threat to score every time he touches the rock. And when it comes to New York, Sports Illustrated insider Albert Breer thinks that Braelon Allen’s role in the Jets’ offense could be “pretty significant” in 2025. Both Wright and Allen already have part-time roles in RBBCs, but if anything happens to the other part of their respective committees (De’Von Achane or Breece Hall), then their fantasy potential opens up like the Red Sea.” – Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts) “There was some excitement for Jaylen Wright this time last year when the Dolphins gave up a future 3rd to move up and draft him in the 4th round, but his season was a bit disappointing. However, Raheem Mostert is out of the picture now, and coach McDaniel loves using 2 RBs in his system. This offense can support another fantasy-relevant RB alongside De’Von Achane; it’s just a matter of who between Wright and newcomers Alexander Mattison and Ollie Gordon II. I’m going to bank on the speedster in Wright to fill that role and make a huge leap in his sophomore year.” – Joey Meinerding (Fantasy Dink) Brashard Smith (RB – KC) “We’ll see how training camp pans out, but if he’s heavily involved in the backfield rotation early, as I expect, I’ll be drafting Brashard Smith everywhere this season as a final-round pick. The Chiefs are no strangers to allowing a seventh-round running back a legit shot at starting (hi, Isiah Pacheco), so we can’t say that Smith has zero shot. I am enamored with Smith’s receiving ability as a converted wide receiver, his lightning quickness, and his possible upside as a rusher for a player who is still getting acclimated to the position. Last year, Smith ranked 34th in breakaway percentage, second in receiving grade, and 22nd in yards per route run (per PFF). Smith’s skill set is different from every other back in this depth chart. He could easily carve out a stand-alone role as Kansas City’s new Jerick McKinnon, with the upside to be their every-down back if Pacheco proves unable to stay healthy again.” – Derek Brown (FantasyPros) Elijah Mitchell (RB – KC) “This isn’t the safest of answers, but I’ll take some chances on Elijah Mitchell/Brashard Smith in case one of them becomes the next shiny toy in the Chiefs’ backfield. Isaiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt have had their time in the sun, to be sure, but they’ve also had plenty of time on the sidelines due to injuries. Mitchell and Smith are both worth late-round dart throws in what is still a dynamic Chiefs’ offense. Whoever wins the RB3 battle is the one to keep an eye on heading into the new season.” – Zach Greubel (Gridiron Experts) MarShawn Lloyd (RB – GB) “MarShawn Lloyd is RB59 by ADP and is a screaming value. He had some of the worst luck ever in his rookie season, but the Packers completely ignored the RB class in 2025 after spending Day 2 capital on Lloyd in the 2024 draft. The Packers, and head coach Matt LaFleur, are outspoken about how much they want to run a committee approach and were forced into Josh Jacobs seeing all those touches in 2024. I expect Lloyd to be featured in a pass-catching/explosive RB 1B role behind Jacobs, with the size to be a great handcuff if the aging Jacobs were to miss time.” – Justin Frye (Pro Football Network) Ray Davis (RB – BUF) “Ray Davis (RB47 in the rankings) is one of my favorite late-round running back draft targets. Buffalo led the NFL with 32 rushing touchdowns last season. James Cook led the league with 16 rushing touchdowns, while Josh Allen had 12 scores. However, Davis also had an impact on the ground, totaling three rushing touchdowns. More importantly, he stood out when Cook missed time due to an injury. The former Kentucky star was outstanding in the one game Cook missed with an injury last year. Davis finished Week 6 as the RB14, totaling 23 touches for 152 scrimmage yards and 16.7 half-point PPR fantasy points despite not scoring a touchdown. The second-year pro is a solid flex option with significant upside if Cook’s contract situation leads to a holdout.” – Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros) “Ray Davis profiles as one of the top late-round steals for 2025. When James Cook missed Week 6 last season, Davis proved he could be a three-down workhorse, racking up 23 touches for 152 total yards. In games where he saw at least a 50% snap share, he averaged over 100 total yards, while ranking in the top five in missed tackles forced per attempt. He also contributed as a pass-catcher, recording 17 receptions and two touchdowns in a limited role. With Cook’s contract situation up in the air and Davis’ ADP sitting outside the top 100, he’s a high-upside lottery ticket that I’ll be targeting everywhere.” – James Emrick-Wilson (Armchair Scouting) Austin Ekeler (RB – WAS) “Austin Ekeler is being left for dead (RB48) in early ECR, even though he was productive when healthy last year and is playing in an exciting, up-and-coming offense. Ekeler scored double-digit PPR points in 8-of-12 games last season and finished RB31 in fantasy points per game. When Brian Robinson Jr. missed a pair of midseason games with a hamstring injury, Ekeler had 134 yards from scrimmage and scored three touchdowns in those two contests. Two of those TDs came against a tough Pittsburgh defense. I’m not expecting a return to the high-end RB1 days for the 30-year-old Ekeler, but I think he’s a value in the later rounds.” – Pat Fitzmaurice (FantasyPros) Audric Estime (RB – DEN) “A player that stands out to me who has legit upside is Audric Estime. In a press conference, head coach Sean Payton said, “He’s a back that requires enough touches. He’s gonna get those opportunities.” Alvin Kamara was selected only 7 picks after RJ Harvey in the 2017 NFL Draft. Kamara and Mark Ingram co-existed in New Orleans, and I think that Estime and Harvey could be Payton’s new Kamara and Ingram. Kamara was the RB4 in FPPG his rookie season, while Ingram was the RB8. Harvey is a great pass-catching RB, just like Kamara, and Estime is a thumper who will run through the defense. Estime had 13 MTF on only 76 rushing attempts last season.” – Nick Penticoff (Fantasy Football Astronauts) Kendre Miller (RB – NO) “For me, it’s target Kendre Miller of the Saints, whom I plan to target outside the top 45 RBs. His current ADP is RB85 and 288th overall, meaning you can use your last pick on him. Miller showed flashes of explosiveness in limited action last season, and with potential changes in the Saints’ backfield as veteran Alvin Kamara nears the age cliff, he could see a significant role. His pass-catching ability fits well in half-PPR formats, offering value if he secures more touches. Kendre Miller’s athleticism and receiving skills make him a breakout candidate if he earns a larger share of the Saints’ backfield in 2025. With Alvin Kamara’s contract situation uncertain and Devin Neal as the only other competition, Miller could capitalize on increased opportunities. His low ADP makes him a high-reward pick with minimal risk in late rounds.” – Aaron St Denis (Fantasy Sports Advice Network) Tyler Allgeier (RB – ATL) “Tyler Allgeier remains one of the NFL’s most efficient and underrated complementary backs. In 2024, he posted a broken tackle rate of 0.26 per carry (top 12 among RBs with at least 100 carries), averaged 3.1 yards after contact per attempt, averaged 4.7 YPC (11th among running backs with at least 100 carries), a 100% catch rate, and recorded a positive run on 83.2% of his carries. While Bijan Robinson is the clear lead in Atlanta, Allgeier carved out a valuable role in short-yardage and red zone situations, logging 31 carries inside the 10-yard line and converting 9 of them into touchdowns. His north-south efficiency, vision between the tackles, and low fumble rate (0.4%) make him a reliable asset providing weekly contributions and an immediate RB1 should anything happen to Bijan.” – Avery Thrasher (The Branded Sports) Which one WR outside the top 55 in half-PPR WR ADP do you plan to target in all drafts as a late-round fantasy football sleeper and why? Kyle Williams (WR – NE) “Even though the Patriots did sign Stefon Diggs to a one-year deal this offseason, there are still massive questions as to who will emerge as the go-to target for Drake Maye. Enter Kyle Williams. The Patriots spent a third-round selection on the former Washington State product, and he comes to New England with the reputation of a burner who runs slick routes and is a YAC (yards after catch) monster. In a new regime, Williams, the current WR63 in half-PPR ADP, has every chance to emerge quickly as the main target for Drake Maye and even overtake Stefon Diggs as the number one target in this New England offense.” – Ed Birdsall (Talking Points Sports) “Rookie receivers are rarely good bets, and New England’s recent history of WR drafting is an unmitigated disaster. But maybe Kyle Williams is ready to break these rules and trends. Williams has the ability to play all over the formation, and perhaps he’s the ideal young talent to grow together with second-year QB Drake Maye. Don’t overlook the hiring of return OC Josh McDaniels — he’s one of those coaches who’s miscast as a head coach but a home run as a play designer. You might not even have to draft Williams; be ready to pounce if he’s available around Halloween, mindful of how first-year skill players often ascend in the second half of their debut season.” – Scott Pianowski (Yahoo! Sports) “When selecting a flyer at wide receiver, I’m looking for two types: a relative unknown with high ceiling or a player returning from injury who showed out in flashes at some point. The latter perfectly describes New Orleans’ Rashid Shaheed, but he doesn’t quite qualify as he’s just inside the top 55. However, the former describes New England’s Kyle Williams, who could face a path of least resistance to a starting job in the Patriots’ patched-together WR room.” – Matt De Lima (Athlon Sports) “There are so many good WR options to pick outside the top 55, but one feels like the clearest path to being the top pass game option, and that’s Patriots rookie Kyle Williams. Stefon Diggs is coming back from a serious knee issue at an advanced age and partying on boats rather than attending workouts. Meanwhile, Williams has a highlight or daily at OTAs showing him getting behind whoever is in coverage. Williams can be used underneath or deep, and with an ascending young QB, I expect the young WR to return solid, probably WR3 level value at WR5 prices.” – Justin Frye (Pro Football Network) “If there’s one word to describe Kyle Williams, it’s explosive. Williams plays faster than his 4.40 forty time from the combine, which is impressive. And while Kyle probably won’t be a high-volume guy, his calling card is big plays. Remember Paul Revere’s ride…..one if by land, two if by sea, and you’re going to want to see Kyle Williams play. The Drake Maye and Kyle Williams connection should provide plenty of celebratory musket shots for Patriots Nation. Ringo’s comp- Kyle Williams reminds me a little of former Carolina all-pro WR Steve Smith Sr.” – Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts) “I desperately want Kyle Williams and Drake Maye to develop a quick rapport this offseason. Williams was one of the more underrated receiver prospects heading into the 2025 draft. The Patriots concurred, taking him with the 69th overall pick despite having recently signed Stefon Diggs. The Washington State standout has some flashes of a healthy Jaylen Waddle in him in a potentially up-and-coming New England offense.” – Zach Greubel (Gridiron Experts) Marvin Mims Jr. (WR – DEN) “Marvin Mims Jr. flashed major upside in the second half of 2024, averaging 62 receiving yards per game and leading all WRs in yards per route run (3.63) from Week 11 onward. He also posted a strong 28% target rate per route run on the year, ranking 13th in the NFL. Still just 23 years old, Mims is a prime third-year breakout candidate in a Broncos offense looking to grow alongside Bo Nix.” – Andrew Erickson (FantasyPros) “Marvin Mims Jr. (WR59 in the rankings) is my favorite late-round wide receiver draft target. The Broncos’ offense became fantasy-friendly late last season. Courtland Sutton was the only non-quarterback that fantasy players could trust for most of the year. However, Mims started to shine over the final two months. He scored 12.3 or more half-point PPR fantasy points in four of the final seven regular-season games, including at least 18.4 in three outings. Many believed Denver would have made a splashy addition at the wide receiver position this offseason. However, that didn’t happen because of how Mims ended last year. He averaged 6.5 receptions for 77 receiving yards, two touchdowns, and 22.9 fantasy points per game over the final two weeks, making several big-time plays for Bo Nix and the offense. Mims should be a popular third-year breakout candidate.” – Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros) “Marvin Mims Jr. (ECR: WR58). Last year, Mims scored six touchdowns over the Broncos’ last seven regular-season games and averaged 62 yards a game over that stretch. He didn’t play half of the Broncos’ offensive snaps in any of those seven games, yet Mims was WR26 in PPR fantasy points per game over that stretch. Mims averaged 0.72 PPR fantasy points per snap in those games. Top fantasy receiver Ja’Marr Chase averaged 0.38 PPR fantasy points per snap last season. Mims is only 23. If his role doesn’t expand, you can waive him without regret. But Mims has flashed exciting potential, making him a perfect late-round flyer.” – Pat Fitzmaurice (FantasyPros) “Marvin Mims Jr. should be a priority target in all Half-PPR fantasy drafts due to his explosive second-half breakout and elite efficiency. He posted 33 receptions, 451 yards, and 6 touchdowns over the final stretch of 2024, averaging 13.7 yards per catch and ranking fourth among WRs in yards per route run (2.57). Mims also led the league in slot target rate (38.2%) and ranked top-10 in targets per route against man coverage (35%), indicating both volume and versatility. His 131.5 passer rating when targeted underscores the trust he earned from quarterbacks. With a more stable role projected for 2025, Mims is a high-upside, late-round value who could emerge as a weekly flex option with WR2 potential.” – Avery Thrasher (The Branded Sports) Emeka Egbuka (WR – TB) “Emeka Egbuka is a sleeper worth targeting late in drafts, offering immediate upside in Tampa Bay’s evolving offense. Selected No. 19 overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, the former Ohio State standout brings elite route running, natural separation skills, and deep-threat explosiveness, making him a strong fit alongside Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. Numerous OTA highlights show Mayfield looking his way often, displaying strong early chemistry as Egbuka flashes his downfield speed and ability to stretch the defense. With his vertical playmaking and ability to keep defenses honest, Egbuka could carve out a significant role sooner than expected. If his early momentum carries into the season, he could outperform his draft cost and become a valuable late-round fantasy asset.” – Lawrence Iacona (Gridiron Experts) “I’d target Emeka Egbuka of the Buccaneers, ranked outside the top 55 in half-PPR ADP on FantasyPros with an ADP WR54. Egbuka, a 2025 first-round pick, brings polished route-running and reliable hands from Ohio State, where he posted two 1,000-yard seasons. Despite a crowded Buccaneers WR room with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, his slot-ready skill set signals high floor potential. With Evans aging and Godwin’s injury history, Egbuka could see significant targets from Day 1. He’s a low-risk, high-reward late-round pick with WR2 upside.” – Aaron St Denis (Fantasy Sports Advice Network) Jalen McMillan (WR – TB) “Jalen McMillan at WR61 (151 overall) seems like the best steal of the later rounds at WR to me. I get that he’s stuck behind both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, but either one of them could miss time this year and launch McMillan into the starting roster discussion. Not only that, in keeper leagues where the round drafted matters, McMillan and Egbuka could be the two WRs in Tampa next season, adding even more value to his late-round price.” – Andrew Hall (FantasyPros) Jayden Higgins (WR – HOU) “Thank you, ADP. Jayden Higgins sitting at WR56 is a gift that EVERYONE should take advantage of. Higgins should immediately file in as the starting outside receiver opposite Nico Collins. Higgins was an underrated player during the entire draft process after ranking 27th and 16th in yards per route run and first and 18th in receiving grade during his final two collegiate seasons (per PFF). With Tank Dell likely out for the entire 2025 season, Higgins has a clear path to playing time with the talent to produce as a WR3 this season.” – Derek Brown (FantasyPros) Wan’Dale Robinson (WR – NYG) “Wan’Dale Robinson had 140 targets last season, the 10th most in the league. Robinson only had 699 receiving yards and three touchdowns, but there is a good chance he will see 120+ targets again this season. Robinson led the team in red zone targets with 17, so we could see him have more touchdowns. The Giants are basically running it back with their skill position group at wide receiver, which is good news for Robinson. You aren’t going to find someone in his draft range who will see the type of target volume he is in store for this year.” – Nick Penticoff (Fantasy Football Astronauts) Jack Bech (WR – LV) “I’m going to try to draft Jack Bech in all my drafts in those later rounds. He was a great playmaker in TCU last year with second-round draft capital, and the opportunity is there with not much competition in the WR room. In these later rounds, you don’t expect much from these players. So if Bech ends up posting WR2 or WR3 numbers, decisions like this could be the reason you make the playoffs in your league. Take a risk on those rookies who have a clear path to fantasy success like Bech.” – Joey Meinerding (Fantasy Dink) Pat Bryant (WR – DEN) “Pat Bryant is one of my favorite deep fantasy football sleepers heading into 2025 drafts. The Broncos’ third-round rookie posted 54 catches for 984 yards and 10 TDs in his final season at Illinois, showcasing strong hands and red-zone reliability. Head coach Sean Payton compared him to Michael Thomas, hinting at a potential high-volume role in a thin receiver room behind Courtland Sutton. While he lacks elite speed (4.61 40-yard dash), Bryant wins with physicality, route discipline, and quite possibly the strongest hands in the class, traits that fit Payton’s offense perfectly. With a current ADP of WR73, Bryant offers strong late-round value and a realistic path to early playing time.” – James Emrick-Wilson (Armchair Scouting) Subscribe: YouTube | Spotify | Apple Podcasts | iHeart | Castbox | Amazon Music | Podcast Addict | TuneIn",2025-06-20,https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/06/20-fantasy-football-sleepers-experts-draft-2025/?lid=r2d5nkuw9suo

Fantasy Football Sleepers 2025: Top Must-Draft Players,"Fantasy Football Sleepers 2025 Introduction Fantasy football never stops, and if you want to stay ahead of the competition, you need to be thinking about sleepers before anyone else. In this article, we’re diving deep into the top must-draft fantasy football sleepers for 2025. These are the players flying under the radar now but will be league winners when the season starts. What Defines a Fantasy Football Sleeper? A sleeper is a player who is undervalued by consensus rankings and the general fantasy football community. These players often provide massive return on investment based on their draft position. In 2024, players like Brian Thomas Jr. and Ladd McConkey were sleeper hits—now, we’re looking for the next breakout stars. Top 7 Must-Draft Fantasy Football Sleepers for 2025 1. Bo Nix (QB, Denver Broncos) Bo Nix finished 7th in fantasy points last year, yet he is currently ranked 13th among quarterbacks. The fantasy industry undervalues him simply because he isn’t a consensus favorite. Let’s break down why Nix is a value pick: - Finished 12th in passing yards - Scored 37.2 fantasy points per game - Outperformed Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray, and Justin Herbert Nix could be an incredible mid-round quarterback steal. If you miss out on elite QBs early, he is an excellent target in drafts. I really like the youth talent and upside. He is a special players and could do better than guys like Pat Mahomes, and Justin Herbert again. Don’t sleep on the young man! I would love to see him get more offensive weapons to boost his production too! 2. Bucky Irving (RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers) Despite finishing 13th among running backs, Bucky Irving is ranked 7th. However, his name isn’t as well-known, which means he might slip in drafts. Consider these numbers: - 207 rushing attempts - 1,122 rushing yards - 5.4 yards per carry - 8 touchdowns Tampa Bay phased Rachaad White out as the season progressed, giving Irving more opportunities. Expect an even larger workload in 2025. Bucky is a hard worker and really likes to pound the ball down the field. He has earnd that RB one spot on the Bucs roster 3. Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR, Arizona Cardinals) Last year, Marvin Harrison Jr. was drafted as a second-round fantasy pick. Now, he’s projected as WR30. This is a steal for someone with his upside: - 21st in targets last season (116 total targets) - 62 receptions, 885 yards, 8 touchdowns - Still growing chemistry with Kyler Murray His numbers will increase in 2025 as the Cardinals’ offense continues to develop. He’s an incredible mid-round pick. He is a really good WR and the talent has to shine this season. You also don’t have to pay the 2nd round fantasy draft capital you did last year. I love the value and upside this season. I will look to target him on my rosters in the mid to late rounds of fantasy drafts. 4. Jalen McMillan (WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers) McMillan finished 55th in 2024, yet he’s projected as WR47. If Chris Godwin leaves Tampa Bay, McMillan has a real chance to shine: - 37 receptions on 58 targets - 461 receiving yards - 8 touchdowns If Godwin moves on, McMillan becomes a top-two receiver on the team, making him a high-upside late-round sleeper. 5. Rome Odunze (WR, Chicago Bears) Odunze was a first-round draft pick in 2024, but many fantasy players overlook him due to the crowded receiver room in Chicago. However, with Keenan Allen likely moving on, Odunze could see a significant increase in volume: - 101 targets in 2024 - The Bears’ best long-term receiving option - Caleb Williams’ projected WR1 With Allen’s departure, Odunze could emerge as the primary target, making him a solid sleeper pick. 6. Ashton Jeanty (RB, Rookie – Projected Cowboys or Chargers Pick) Ashton Jeanty is an elite rookie sleeper. Currently ranked RB19, his value will skyrocket when his landing spot is confirmed. Here’s why he’s a must-watch sleeper: - 2,600 total yards in college - 370 total touches - Strong receiving ability - Second in Heisman Trophy voting If Jeanty lands on the Cowboys or Chargers, expect him to be a major fantasy asset. 7. Bonus Sleeper – Veteran Values Older receivers like Stefon Diggs, Deebo Samuel, and Michael Pittman Jr. are all slipping in draft rankings, making them incredible value picks in later rounds. These players still have production upside despite falling out of favor with consensus rankings. I personally don’t like older players, but these guys could be outstanding value in 2025. Final Thoughts The key to dominating your fantasy football league is identifying value before the mainstream rankings catch up. Bo Nix, Bucky Irving, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jalen McMillan, Rome Odunze, and Ashton Jeanty are prime sleepers that could win your league in 2025.",2025-02-18,https://thefantasyfootballcounselor.com/fantasy-football-sleepers-2025-top-must-draft-players/
Matthew Berry's Top 100 Overall Rankings for 2025 fantasy football season,"Now that the NFL draft is behind us and training camps are ramping up we have a much clearer picture of the NFL landscape, it’s time to update and expand my overall rankings from Top 50 to Top 100. While these rankings are obviously adaptable, they are for a 1 QB league with full PPR scoring. And as we get closer to fantasy draft season, these rankings will expand again to a Top 200. As always, please let me know what you think of the rankings – what you agree with, what you don’t – on social media where I am @MatthewBerryTMR on all forms of social media (X/Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky) except the Bleacher Nation Fantasy App where I am merely @MatthewBerry.

2025 Fantasy Football Rankings: Roundtable Picks & Debates,"Welcome to the first installment of our RotoWire Roundtable 2025 fantasy football rankings.

This year's Roundtable has a disagreement right at the top. Three of the four writers ranked Ja'Marr Chase No. 1, but Coventry went against ADP (and RotoWire projections) and put Chase, not second, but third. He has Saquon Barkley in the top spot followed by Bijan Robinson. Coventry was also out of step with the consensus on Jahmyr Gibbs. Erickson and Puig both ranked Gibbs second while Donabedian has him third; Coventry ranked Gibbs seventh. Consensus was hard to find in the top 10.

2025 Fantasy Football Draft Rankings: Fitz’s Early Picks & Predictions,"We’ve entered the fantasy football “offseason.” Those aren’t scare quotes around the word “offseason.” They’re more like mockery quotes, because so many of the people who have embraced fantasy football as a hobby are deeply immersed in it, committed to keeping up with it year-round, even though there won’t be another regular-season game until September. Fantasy football isn’t just a hobby; it’s a compulsion. Check out Fitz’s Early 2025 Fantasy Football Mock Draft And so here I am, rolling out 2025 fantasy football draft rankings roughly seven months before home-league drafts start to take place. Putting together early fantasy draft rankings is always fun, but it’s also a tricky exercise. There’s a lot of projection involved. Rosters are going to change. Some coaching staffs are going to change. Free agency will dramatically alter the fantasy landscape. So will the NFL Draft. And it’s impossible to tell exactly how those events will change things — although we can make some educated guesses. These rankings reintroduce some players who were lost to major injuries in 2024. They also include some players who sustained major injuries late in the 2024 season and may or may not be able to contribute in 2025. These rankings also include rookies. Plugging rookies into such an early set of rankings involves some serious guesswork. Combine testing, draft results and yet-to-be-completed rookie research will make rookie rankings extremely volatile in the coming months. Heck, we don’t even know who all of the early declarers are yet. So, please understand that these are mere placeholder rankings for the rookies, subject to significant changes. But I wanted to include rookies in these early rankings, because early rankings that don’t include rookies are pretty useless. These fantasy football draft rankings are a starting point. I hope you’ll check back frequently as I continue to make adjustments over the months to come. Here are my early 2025 fantasy football draft rankings. 2025 Fantasy Football Draft Rankings Subscribe: YouTube | Spotify | Apple Podcasts | iHeart | Castbox | Amazon Music | Podcast Addict | TuneIn",2025-01-06,https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/01/2025-fantasy-football-draft-rankings-fitzs-early-picks-predictions/
The Mock Draft project: 2025's most wanted fantasy football picks,"Rankings are great. They're the blueprint from which we build our fantasy football rosters. But drafting a fantasy football team isn't as simple as following a list of players. There's nuance. Science. Art. Not an insignificant amount of luck. Whenever you draft, be it a mock or the real thing, if you were to do it again immediately, chances are you'd end up with completely different results. So, we thought we'd do exactly that with our team of fantasy football analysts. Over the course of a month following the NFL draft, each of our analysts was given the opportunity to draft twice from each of the draft slots in a 10-team league. We conducted 34 mocks, rotating in substitutes to account for availability and to insert a little variety into the picks, and tracked the results, which you'll find below. These results were also used to inform the rankings you'll find in the ESPN fantasy football draft platform. Here is a quick breakdown of what you'll find compiled for the nearly 200 players who were taken during this exercise. Pos Rank: The player's overall rank among players at his position. ADP: The player's average draft position accounting for all 34 mocks conducted. High: The highest draft pick used to select a player Low: The lowest draft pick used to select a player. ""ND"" means there was at least one draft where this player was not taken. Preferred by: The ESPN analyst who selected that player more often than any other analyst. The percentage of drafts in which they took the player is listed in parentheses. Only the most recent 20 drafts consisting of two picks from each of the 10 draft slots were considered. Preferred ADP: The average draft pick used by that analyst to select that player, with the same caveat as described in the ""Preferred By"" category. The drafters (alphabetically by last name): Stephania Bell, Matt Bowen, Mike Clay, Tristan H. Cockcroft, Daniel Dopp, Tyler Fulghum, Eric Karabell, Liz Loza, Eric Moody and Field Yates. Fantasy editors Pierre Becquey, Keith Lipscomb and Joe Kaiser, as well as ESPN Stats & Information researchers Mackenzie Kraemer, Kevin Pulsifer and Daniel Ayotte, participated in drafts when not all 10 analysts were available. Below the draft chart you will find a list of every analyst's most-taken players in their most recent 20 mock drafts: three quarterbacks, eight running backs, eight wide receivers, and two each at tight end, kicker and defense.

"Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year","Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year SportsLine simulated the new NFL season 10,000 times and identified 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts for upcoming drafts Raiders tight end Brock Bowers is coming off the most prolific season for a rookie tight end in NFL history after catching 112 passes for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns. He was first-team All-Pro despite playing with three different starting quarterbacks, and there's optimism that the offseason additions of Geno Smith and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty will only aid his production. Where exactly should you be targeting Bowers in your upcoming 2025 Fantasy football drafts? Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren were top 14 picks at tight end in the 2025 NFL Draft as Bowers was last year, but is either ready to slot into your Fantasy football lineups this season? A reliable set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer those questions and also identify potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts before you go on the clock. A reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer that question while also identifying potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts. Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and non-PPR leagues, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel. His hybridized usage in San Francisco led to one of the great seasons in recent Fantasy football history when he caught 77 passes for 1,405 yards and six touchdowns while adding 59 carries for 365 yards and eight touchdowns in 2021. However, as the 49ers added weapons, his usage dropped off, and he's also had to fight through injuries in recent years, missing eight games the last three seasons and playing through several more while hampered. Now he'll have a chance for a career reset in Washington with NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels, and he could begin the season as Washington's No. 1 receiver. Terry McLaurin is in a serious contract dispute and has been the constant subject of NFL trade rumors all offseason. Even if McLaurin's situation gets sorted, offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury should have plenty of wrinkles for Samuel, and the model predicts that he far exceeds expectations as the No. 39 wide receiver off the board on average. See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Colts tight end Tyler Warren. After an All-American career at Penn State, in which he not only had 19 touchdown receptions but also six rushing scores, Warren was the second tight end taken in the NFL Draft. He joins a Colts team in desperate need of uptick at the position as no Indy tight end had more than 14 catches or 182 yards last year. Indianapolis didn't spend a first round pick on Warren to just use him as a blocker as it has high hopes for the 2024 Mackey Award winner as the best tight end in college football. Indy used a tight end on roughly 98% of its offensive plays last season and used multiple tight ends on over a quarter of all snaps. Thus, the position clearly has a big role in the offense. The learning curve for rookie tight ends is also not as steep as in the past as players like Brock Bowers and Sam LaPorta were top-two Fantasy tight ends in their first years. SportsLine's model has Warren ahead of more established tight ends like Kyle Pitts and Evan Engram in its Fantasy football 2025 rankings. See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football busts As for players to avoid, the model lists 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. Throughout his career, when Christian McCaffrey has been healthy, he's been the most productive Fantasy football running back there is. However, we've reached the stage of his career where reliability has become a huge concern, as he's missed 10 games or more in three of the last five seasons after going three seasons without missing a game to start his career. Injuries limited McCaffrey to four games last season and his production was minimal when he was in the lineup. After piling up 2,023 scrimmage yards and scoring 21 touchdowns in his first full season with the 49ers in 2023, McCaffrey only managed 348 scrimmage yards and didn't score a single touchdown. The consensus No. 1 overall pick in last year's Fantasy football drafts was a massive liability, but he's still going at the tail end of the first round this season and is the fourth RB off the board on average. The model ranks him outside its top 10 running backs for 2025 and doesn't see him living up to his Fantasy football ADP. See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here.

Bust-proof Fantasy Football draft picks for 2025 that the Fantasy Football Today team has pinpointed,"Bust-proof Fantasy Football draft picks for 2025 that the Fantasy Football Today team has pinpointed These players won't derail your 2025 Fantasy seasons Ja'Marr Chase has most commonly been selected with the No. 1 overall draft pick in our Fantasy Football mock drafts and expert drafts this offseason to date, but what would he need to score to be considered ""not a bust"" with first overall draft capital? That's the question Fantasy Football Today sought to answer in a recent episode with Adam Aizer, Jamey Eisenberg, Dave Richard, and Heath Cummings. We'll take a look into some of the stats that define what a bust is and then pinpoint some of the bust-proof players for the 2025 season that you should look to target in your 2025 Fantasy Football drafts. Aizer did a little digging and found that the first round hasn't been as ""bust-proof"" and safe as we've wanted it to be. Over the last five seasons, 20 PPR Fantasy points per game would have been good enough to be WR4, WR4, WR5, WR5, and WR3 on a per-game basis. Chase, for example, has averaged 18, 20.5, 16.4, and 23.7 PPR FPs per game in his four NFL seasons. Chase would not have met the criteria under the assumption that a player would need more than 20 Fantasy points per game to not be considered a bust at No. 1 overall in half of his NFL seasons. And yet, based on his 2024 season, he is most often selected No. 1 overall (similar to what we've seen with CeeDee Lamb and others in past Fantasy years). Over the last two Fantasy seasons, these were our Round 1 busts: 2024: Christian McCaffrey, Lamb, Tyreek Hill, Breece Hall, AJ Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Garrett Wilson 2023: Justin Jefferson (injury), Chase, Austin Ekeler, Saquon Barkley (RB9 per game), Bijan Robinson, Stefon Diggs, Nick Chubb (injury), Davante Adams. Not all of these players derailed your Fantasy season (Barkley in 2023, for example), but none of them proved to be worth drafting at their first-round capital. As we move forward to the 2025 Fantasy season, these are some of the players Jamey, Dave, and Heath have identified as bust-proof: Dave suggests Lamar Jackson as a quarterback who is bust-proof for 2025. Here's what Heath wrote up on Jackson in his 2025 player outlook: ""Jackson was the No. 1 QB in Fantasy last year and arguably should have won his third MVP. Heading into 2025, we view him as one of a trio of QBs who are worthy to be selected as the first QB off the board, as early as No. 1 overall in Superflex and Round 3 in one-QB leagues. Expect his passing totals to regress in 2025 as he is coming off a season when he averaged 8.8 yards per pass attempt, a full yard better than his career average, and an 8.6% touchdown rate, more than two points higher than his career rate. But he was three Fantasy points per game better than any other QB last year, so he could regress and still be QB1 overall. Traditionally, Jackson is worth more in leagues that reward four points per pass touchdown, but that wasn't the case last year when he led the NFL in passing touchdowns."" Is Jonathan Taylor a bust-proof back for 2025? Dave believes so because he's a running back who has a big grip on the workload, a similar scheme to 2024, and a likelihood of getting all of the touchdowns. Here's what Jamey wrote up about Taylor in his 2025 outlook: ""Taylor should once again be considered a No. 1 Fantasy running back this season, and he should be drafted in Round 2 in all leagues. His value is higher in half and non-PPR leagues, but Taylor can still be highly productive in PPR, even with a lack of receptions. In 2024, Taylor had a career-low 18 receptions for 136 yards and one touchdown on 31 targets. But he was dominant on the ground with 1,431 yards and 11 touchdowns on 303 carries, and he closed the season on an impressive run with three games in a row with at least 25 PPR points, while averaging 30.8 PPR points per game over that stretch. We'll see who starts at quarterback for the Colts between Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones, but neither quarterback should dramatically alter the Fantasy value for Taylor. We'll see if he shares touches with new backups in Khalil Herbert or rookie D.J. Giddens, but it's hard to envision Taylor coming off the field much when healthy. He once again has top-10 upside in all leagues in 2025."" *For more on this conversation, subscribe to listen to the Fantasy Football Today podcast here and wherever you get your podcasts.*",2025-06-18,https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/bust-proof-fantasy-football-draft-picks-for-2025-that-the-fantasy-football-today-team-has-pinpointed/
"Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year","Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year SportsLine simulated the new NFL season 10,000 times and identified 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts for upcoming drafts Raiders tight end Brock Bowers is coming off the most prolific season for a rookie tight end in NFL history after catching 112 passes for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns. He was first-team All-Pro despite playing with three different starting quarterbacks, and there's optimism that the offseason additions of Geno Smith and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty will only aid his production. Where exactly should you be targeting Bowers in your upcoming 2025 Fantasy football drafts? Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren were top 14 picks at tight end in the 2025 NFL Draft as Bowers was last year, but is either ready to slot into your Fantasy football lineups this season? A reliable set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer those questions and also identify potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts before you go on the clock. A reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer that question while also identifying potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts. Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and non-PPR leagues, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel. His hybridized usage in San Francisco led to one of the great seasons in recent Fantasy football history when he caught 77 passes for 1,405 yards and six touchdowns while adding 59 carries for 365 yards and eight touchdowns in 2021. However, as the 49ers added weapons, his usage dropped off, and he's also had to fight through injuries in recent years, missing eight games the last three seasons and playing through several more while hampered. Now he'll have a chance for a career reset in Washington with NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels, and he could begin the season as Washington's No. 1 receiver. Terry McLaurin is in a serious contract dispute and has been the constant subject of NFL trade rumors all offseason. Even if McLaurin's situation gets sorted, offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury should have plenty of wrinkles for Samuel, and the model predicts that he far exceeds expectations as the No. 39 wide receiver off the board on average. See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Colts tight end Tyler Warren. After an All-American career at Penn State, in which he not only had 19 touchdown receptions but also six rushing scores, Warren was the second tight end taken in the NFL Draft. He joins a Colts team in desperate need of uptick at the position as no Indy tight end had more than 14 catches or 182 yards last year. Indianapolis didn't spend a first round pick on Warren to just use him as a blocker as it has high hopes for the 2024 Mackey Award winner as the best tight end in college football. Indy used a tight end on roughly 98% of its offensive plays last season and used multiple tight ends on over a quarter of all snaps. Thus, the position clearly has a big role in the offense. The learning curve for rookie tight ends is also not as steep as in the past as players like Brock Bowers and Sam LaPorta were top-two Fantasy tight ends in their first years. SportsLine's model has Warren ahead of more established tight ends like Kyle Pitts and Evan Engram in its Fantasy football 2025 rankings. See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football busts As for players to avoid, the model lists 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. Throughout his career, when Christian McCaffrey has been healthy, he's been the most productive Fantasy football running back there is. However, we've reached the stage of his career where reliability has become a huge concern, as he's missed 10 games or more in three of the last five seasons after going three seasons without missing a game to start his career. Injuries limited McCaffrey to four games last season and his production was minimal when he was in the lineup. After piling up 2,023 scrimmage yards and scoring 21 touchdowns in his first full season with the 49ers in 2023, McCaffrey only managed 348 scrimmage yards and didn't score a single touchdown. The consensus No. 1 overall pick in last year's Fantasy football drafts was a massive liability, but he's still going at the tail end of the first round this season and is the fourth RB off the board on average. The model ranks him outside its top 10 running backs for 2025 and doesn't see him living up to his Fantasy football ADP. See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here.

Early Fantasy Rankings 2025: Who's the First Overall Pick?,"Introduction Fantasy football enthusiasts, it’s never too early to start preparing for your 2025 draft! Every year, the mainstream rankings recycle the same names without factoring in regression, injuries, or team changes. That’s why staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Today, we’re diving into who should be the first overall pick in Fantasy Football 2025—backed by logic, not hype. The Usual Suspects: Are They Worth the Top Pick? Saquon Barkley Saquon Barkley has been a dominant force, and after a massive 2024 season, he is once again atop early rankings. However, history tells us that running backs coming off career years tend to regress. The Super Bowl hangover, potential injury risks, and statistical drop-offs make him a risky pick at #1. Ja’marr Chase Many fantasy analysts are pushing Jamar Chase as a potential top pick, but is a wide receiver really the best choice? Historically, wide receivers do not provide the same positional advantage as elite running backs. While Chase will deliver WR1 numbers, you can find valuable WRs later in the draft, making him a reach at #1 overall. Why Running Back Should Still Be Your Priority If you want to win your fantasy league, you must build around a robust RB strategy. Every year, we see the scarcity at running back become a problem. Players who go WR-heavy early often struggle due to the lack of reliable RBs later in the draft. Some early-round WRs in 2024—Tyreek Hill, Puka Nacua, Deebo Samuel—disappointed fantasy managers. Meanwhile, smart drafters who secured strong RBs dominated their leagues. The Case for Bijan Robinson Bijan Robinson is in a prime breakout spot for 2025. Unlike Barkley, who may regress, Robinson is on the rise. The Atlanta Falcons struggled with poor coaching and inconsistent quarterback play, but with Arthur Smith gone and potential offensive improvements, Bijan is set to explode. He has youth, talent, and potential elite workload—everything you want in a first overall pick. What About Jahmyr Gibbs? Jahmyr Gibbs is another exciting option, but there’s a major concern: David Montgomery’s presence in Detroit. Gibbs flashed elite potential, but as long as Montgomery is taking 180-210 carries, his upside is capped. That makes him risky for a first overall pick, though he remains a solid mid-first-round option. Other Names to Watch Derrick Henry At 30+ years old, Derrick Henry may have already had his last elite fantasy season. While he remains a top-five RB consideration, taking him first overall is too risky. Marvin Harrison Jr. There’s buzz around rookie WR Marvin Harrison Jr., but again, QB play dictates WR success. Until we know more about his landing spot, it’s impossible to justify him at #1 overall. Conclusion: Who Should Be the #1 Pick? - Best overall choice: Bijan Robinson (High upside, young, potential RB1 workload) - Risky but possible: Saquon Barkley (Potential regression, but elite talent) - Avoid as #1 overall: Wide receivers (Can get value later in the draft) Final Thoughts Fantasy football is all about avoiding regression candidates, securing workhorses, and maximizing value. As of now, Bijan Robinson stands out as the best first overall pick for 2025. But as the offseason unfolds, coaching changes, draft picks, and team moves could shift the rankings.

Who to Draft With the 2025 Number 1 Pick in Fantasy Football,"You're on the clock with the coveted #1 pick. Having the first pick in the 2025 fantasy football draft puts you in the driver's seat - and the pressure cooker. With elite options like Ja'Marr Chase, Saquon Barkley, and Bijan Robinson all vying for that top spot, your choice sets the tone for the entire draft. Whether you prioritize positional scarcity, youth, or upside, hitting on the 1.01 is crucial for building a championship-caliber roster in what promises to be another high-scoring, unpredictable season. The luxury of being able to select whomever you like is balanced by the fact that the number 1 pick doesn't always pay off. Ask fantasy managers who took Christian McCaffrey first last year how they did in their leagues. He missed the entire season. If that feels like deja vu, recall Le'Veon Bell in 2018 who was widely taken at the #1 spot only to miss the entire season. The top pick not playing the whole year will utterly ruin your season, but even players like Jonathan Taylor in 2022, Dalvin Cook in 2021, or Eddie Lacy in 2015 ruined postseason chances for fantasy managers by wildly under-performing their expectations. Having the #1 pick does not guarantee you fantasy success. Here are the players that we feel are in contention for that first round pick in 2025. Ja'Marr Chase, WR - Cincinnati Bengals Ja'Marr Chase put together a legendary campaign in 2024, securing the WR triple crown by leading the league in targets, receptions, yards, and touchdowns. His 403 PPR points marked the 15th-best season for a wide receiver in fantasy football history, and he finished as the WR1 by a wide margin. With a massive 27.9% target share and dominant red-zone usage, Chase proved to be an unstoppable force in Cincinnati's high-octane, pass-first offense. Lining up both wide and in the slot, Chase created mismatches all over the field. Despite high volume, he maintained elite efficiency - ranking top-10 in yards per route run and yards after catch per reception. His short-area explosiveness and ability to operate as a versatile threat allowed the Bengals to stay aggressive even with subpar pass protection. Notably, Chase's production actually improved when Tee Higgins was healthy, reinforcing his consistency regardless of surrounding personnel. Heading into 2025, Chase is locked in as Cincinnati's offensive centerpiece and a near-unanimous 1.01 pick in both PPR and half-PPR formats. With Joe Burrow coming off a career-best season and the Bengals maintaining a fast-paced, pass-heavy scheme, Chase is poised to deliver another year of elite fantasy production. He enters the season healthy and with no meaningful competition for targets, making him one of the safest and most explosive picks on the board. Bijan Robinson, RB - Atlanta Falcons Bijan Robinson is heading into 2025 with serious momentum after finishing as the RB4 in PPR scoring last season. He surged in the second half of the year, averaging over 22 points per game and trailing only two backs in total PPR output during that stretch. With 1,456 rushing yards, 14 touchdowns on the ground, and another 431 receiving yards on 61 catches, Robinson proved himself as a dual-threat centerpiece in Atlanta's offense. At just 23 years old, he's entering his physical prime with the potential to lead all running backs in fantasy production this season. Robinson's late-season breakout coincided with a heavier workload, including a significant boost in carries and goal-line touches. From Week 9 on, he handled over 65% of the team's carries and dominated red-zone opportunities. He maintained efficiency with 4.8 yards per carry behind a top-tier offensive line, while also grading highly in both rushing and receiving metrics according to Pro Football Focus. His all-around skill set gives Atlanta flexibility, and his involvement in both the ground game and passing attack makes him a true workhorse. With the Falcons retaining their coaching staff and core offensive personnel, Robinson's role remains secure. Quarterback Michael Penix takes over full-time under center, and while there's some uncertainty with his range of outcomes, the offense is still expected to lean heavily on the run. Atlanta returns four of five offensive line starters and projects as a strong unit overall. All signs point to another high-volume, high-efficiency season for Robinson in 2025. Saquon Barkley, RB - Philadelphia Eagles After a phenomenal 2024 season that saw Saquon Barkley lead the NFL in rushing yards with 2,005 and finish as the RB1 in Standard and Half-PPR formats, some regression in 2025 seems likely - but his elite role remains unchanged. Barkley handled a league-high 345 carries and added value as a pass-catcher with 33 receptions and two touchdowns. Despite a limited receiving role and goal-line competition from Jalen Hurts, Barkley's fantasy ceiling stays sky-high in Philadelphia's run-heavy scheme. Barkley's production was powered by one of the best offensive lines in football and a scheme that leaned heavily on the ground game. He averaged a staggering 5.8 yards per carry and ranked near the top in rush yards over expected and breakaway percentage. While the infamous ""tush push"" limited some of his scoring upside near the goal line, Barkley still finished top-10 in red-zone carries and maintained elite efficiency. The offense's design, paired with the return of stars like Hurts, A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith, continues to put Barkley in a prime position to produce. Looking ahead to 2025, Barkley remains the clear bell cow in Philly's backfield. With Kenneth Gainwell gone and only minimal depth behind him, Barkley should maintain a dominant workload. While new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo hasn't called plays before, he's expected to keep the Eagles' ground-first identity intact. Barkley enters his age-28 season with a massive role, a strong supporting cast, and minimal injury concerns - making him one of the safest bets in fantasy at the top of the RB ranks. Justin Jefferson, WR - Minnesota Vikings Justin Jefferson proved once again in 2024 that elite talent can thrive regardless of quarterback play. Even with Sam Darnold under center for much of the year, Jefferson racked up 103 receptions for 1,533 yards and 10 touchdowns, finishing as the WR2 in PPR formats. He remained the focal point of Minnesota's passing game, earning a 28.1% target share on the season and consistently producing big plays with a league-best mix of route-running precision, volume, and explosiveness. Jefferson's efficiency stayed elite across nearly every advanced metric. He ranked fourth in both yards per route run (2.61) and PFF receiving grade (90.3), while also maintaining strong separation and first-read target rates. Although his role slightly shifted in the back half of the season, Jefferson continued to command attention from defenses and his offensive scheme alike. Head coach Kevin O'Connell's system, even with a slight dip in pass rate, still generated one of the league's most productive air attacks. Looking ahead to 2025, Jefferson remains the undisputed WR1 in Minnesota's offense. Despite the uncertainty surrounding rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy, Jefferson's locked-in volume, supporting cast, and track record of success make him one of the safest and most valuable fantasy options. With a strong offensive line, a healthy T.J. Hockenson returning, and complementary weapons like Jordan Addison drawing defensive attention, Jefferson is poised for another high-end fantasy season. Jahmyr Gibbs, RB - Detroit Lions Jahmyr Gibbs exploded in 2024, finishing as fantasy football's PPR RB1 thanks to a dazzling mix of efficiency, explosiveness, and scoring. He totaled 1,412 yards, tied for the league lead with 16 rushing touchdowns, and added 52 catches for over 500 receiving yards. Despite sharing touches with David Montgomery, Gibbs delivered nine top-10 weekly performances and only one game outside RB2 territory - highlighting a floor as solid as his ceiling is electric. Gibbs shined even in a split backfield, averaging 18.4 PPR points per game on just 14.4 expected points. When Montgomery missed time, Gibbs elevated his game to another level, averaging over 32 fantasy points per outing. He was one of the league's most efficient runners, ranking top-10 in rush yards over expected, breakaway rate, and missed tackles forced. His pass-catching prowess remained strong, though pass protection still lags behind. Importantly, he stayed healthy across all 17 games, easing prior concerns about his durability. Heading into 2025, Gibbs returns to a familiar role in Detroit's high-powered offense, now led by new OC John Morton, who plans to keep Ben Johnson's successful system intact. The offensive line remains a strength despite the retirement of center Frank Ragnow, and the supporting cast - including Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, and Sam LaPorta - ensures plenty of scoring chances. While Montgomery's presence may slightly cap Gibbs' ceiling, he remains a locked-in RB1 with elite weekly upside. Bottom Line You really can't go wrong with any of these players at the number 1 spot, so it comes down to nuances like the scoring format. While Barkley was an absolute beast last year, virtually everyone agrees that some level of regression is coming. Chase brought home championships for many last year, but his value is intrinsically tied to Joe Burrow's health (missed 16 games including the final seven games of 2023). Bijan should have a consistent workload this year, but to be effective he's going to need the Atlanta passing game to step up and keep defenses from stacking the box. Jefferson remains a solid pick but nearly every expert we're tracking has him at least one to two points behind Chase every game. Gibbs crushed it in PPR leagues last year but will always have a lower ceiling with a talented David Montgomery behind him. In Standard formats, we're taking Bijan Robinson because he offers the rare trifecta of talent, volume, and youth. Coming off a dominant 2024 season where he racked up over 1,800 total yards and 15 touchdowns, Robinson showcased elite dual-threat ability - finishing top-5 in both rushing and receiving categories among running backs. At just 23 years old, he's entering the prime of his career with a feature role in Atlanta's run-focused offense. With continuity in coaching, a strong offensive line, and a clear path to 20+ touches per game, Robinson checks every box for a top fantasy pick. In PPR formats, we're going to be clicking on Ja'Marr Chase with our first pick. The massive target share combined with polished talent allowed him to be effective regardless of matchup or game script. Unlike top running backs, Chase offers elite production without the volatility tied to injuries or split workloads. In full-PPR formats, especially, he gives you the kind of consistent, explosive output that wins championships. If you're sitting at 1.01, Chase offers the rare blend of safety and upside that makes him the smart, strategic pick. In HALF-PPR formats, we're going to stay with Ja'Marr Chase for the same reasons above.",2025-07-05,https://www.fantasynerds.com/news/article/754/who-to-draft-with-the-2025-number-1-pick-in-fantasy-football
Way-Too-Early 2025 Fantasy Football Rankings: Top 25,"Getting ready to enjoy a long and relaxing fantasy offseason? Of course, you’re not. As soon as this year’s fantasy season ended, many of us — myself included — began thinking about 2025 Fantasy Football Rankings. To help you prepare, here are my Way-Too-Early 2025 Fantasy Football Rankings: Top 25 Players. Massive, landscape-altering events are on the horizon. January feels way too early to even consider producing an early ranking—we should at least be prudent enough to wait until after the Super Bowl. Who am I kidding? Here’s my early take on the Top 25 for 2025, with some shoutouts to Fantasy Points Data for the dank stats. The Top 25 Fantasy Football Players for 2025 1. Ja’Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals, 24 Years Old Chase hit the wide receiver trifecta. He is having one of the most dominant fantasy seasons ever at the position, leading the league in catches (127), touchdown receptions (17), and receiving yardage (1,708). Chase is in his prime and tied to one of the league’s best quarterbacks in Joe Burrow. After a running back-dominant 2024 fantasy season, 2025 is officially the Revenge of the Wide Receiver, with Chase leading the charge. 2. Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles, 27 Years Old Drafters were able to steal Barkley at the 1-2 turn this past season, but the price of a brick just went up. Barkley thrived in his first season in Philadelphia, surpassing even the wildest dreams of his biggest enthusiasts. He averaged a career-high 5.8 yards per carry on his way to a 22.2 PPG average. Barkley became the ninth running back in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards and scored 15 touchdowns. Ageists look away — you’re drafting a soon-to-be 28-year-old as the first running back off the board. 3. Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions, 22 Years Old Touchdowns scored over their first two seasons in the league: Barry Sanders, 30; Jahmyr Gibbs, 31. Gibbs (21.3 PPG) finished as the RB1 overall and trailed only Barkley and Chase among all players in PPG. He accomplished this despite his teammate David Montgomery scoring 12 rushing touchdowns. Gibbs is a dynamic and explosive talent who has thrived in his first two seasons in the league. His four-TD performance in Week 18, propelling Detroit to the NFC North title, will be remembered for years to come. He is the type of player who can break fantasy. 4. Bijan Robinson, RB, Atlanta Falcons, 23 Years Old Speaking of league-winner younger backs, Robinson took massive strides in his second season in the league in Zac Robinson’s first season as the Atlanta Falcons OC. He averaged 20.1 PPG and finished with 1,887 combined yards. Atlanta could be even more running-back-centric with Michael Penix Jr. taking over as the starting quarterback in the ATL. 5. De’Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins, 23 Years Old Achane led all running backs in receptions (78), receiving yardage (592), and touchdown catches (6). His yards per carry number dipped considerably from his insane rookie season (4.1 down from 7.8) as his role and the offense changed. One of the most lethal weapons in fantasy, Achane has scored 23 touchdowns in 28 regular season games. He has RB1 overall potential in 2025. 6. Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings, 25 Years Old Jefferson has been so dominant throughout his first five seasons in the league, that fantasy managers were somewhat disappointed that he “only” averaged 18.7 PPG. There will be question marks for the Minnesota Vikings this offseason . namely who will be their starting quarterback in 2025: Sam Darnold or JJ McCarthy. But there will be zero questions when it comes to Jefferson. Just draft him. 7. Puka Nacua, WR, LA Rams, 23 Years Old The WR1 overall has led the league in targets and catches every year for the past four seasons. Few players in football possess Nacua's target ceiling potential. He could be in store put up a season comparable to Cooper Kupp’s league winner run in 2021. Nacua could become the NFL’s next 200-target player at some point in his career. You are going to want exposure to Nacua in 2025. 8. CeeDee Lamb, WR, Dallas Cowboys, 25 Years Old Lamb has three straight seasons with at least 150 targets and 100 catches. This year, Lamb overcame a slow start and the season-ending loss to starting quarterback Dak Prescott and still managed to average 17.6 PPG. An AC joint injury ended Lamb’s season during one of his best fantasy stretches of the year. From Weeks 14-16, he averaged 21.8 PPG. 9. Amon-Ra St.Brown, WR, Detroit Lions, 25 Years Old The Sun God has three straight seasons with at least 106 receptions and 1,161 receiving yards. There were many mouths to feed in Ben Johnson's offense, and teammate Jameson Williams emerged this season, but it didn’t matter — St. Brown is a target vacuum. He also has 22 touchdown catches over the past two seasons, trailing only Mike Evans and Chase. 10. Nico Collins, WR, Houston Texans, 25 Years Old Collins has emerged over the last two seasons as a model of consistency and the focal point of the Houston offense. He averaged 17.4 PPG in 2023, and 17.3 this season. It feels like we still have not seen what a true ceiling outcome is for Collins. 2025 could be the year for him to reach it and have a peak Julio Jones-like performance finally. 11. Brian Thomas Jr., WR, Jacksonville Jaguars, 22 Years Old This ranking may be too aggressive for some right now, but this is where you’ll have to draft BTJ if you want him in August. Simply put, his rookie year was phenomenal. The Jaguars were a bottom-8 offense, averaging only 18.8 PPG as a team. Trevor Lawrence missed multiple games. Many things went wrong for Jacksonville, but BTJ was not one of them. Thomas Jr. had one of the best seasons ever for a rookie WR—finishing tied for fifth with 10 touchdown catches, fifth in receiving yardage with 1,282 yards, and setting a Jacksonville rookie record with 87 receptions. We could be looking at the next Josh Gordon. 12. Malik Nabers, WR, New York Giants, 21 Years Old Nabers could easily be higher on this list, but there are question marks surrounding the quarterback position in New York. If the Giants can make a splash at quarterback, Nabers will rise accordingly. Usage-wise, Nabers had no peers this season. He led all players in target share (32.4%), ranked top three in air yards share (45.9%), and led the NFL in first-read rate at 42.8%—all at the age of 21. Despite missing two games, Nabers broke Nacua’s all-time record for receptions by a rookie wide receiver with 109. He also broke the Giants record for catches in a season held previously by Steve Smith. 13. Brock Bowers, TE, Las Vegas Raiders, 22 Years Old Bowers will be the consensus TE1 overall heading into 2025, and seemingly for the rest of this career. The torch has officially been passed from Travis Kelce to Bowers. Drafters looking for a positional edge can look no further. Bowers obliterated the rookie record for catches at the tight end position with 112, obliterating the previous record held by Sam LaPorta (86). He also broke Mike Ditka’s record for receiving yardage with 1,144. The sky is the limit in 2025. 14. AJ Brown, WR, Philadelphia Eagles, 27 Years Old This ranking could look laughably low a year from now, but I prefer to push a few younger wide receivers ahead of Brown as he falls to the early second round. The Kellen Moore offense could explode in year two, but Saquon Barkley isn’t going anywhere, and neither is Jalen Hurts’ tush. Brown (16.7 PPG this season) is still a weapon of mass destruction in fantasy, capable of delivering immense spike weeks that can win just about any matchup. 15. Josh Jacobs, RB, Green Bay Packers, 26 Years Old Jacobs could have easily been included inside of the Top 10 overall picks. His first year in Green Bay was a dominant one, especially over the second half of the season. Jacobs finished fourth in the NFL with 15 rushing TDs — a career-high. Twelve of them occurred during his last eight games. The Green Bay offense could be even better in 2025, and Jacobs will be the focal point of it. 16. Ashton Jeanty, RB, TBD, 21 Years Old I will by no means apologize to anyone for ranking Jeanty this highly. In fact, I should rank him even higher. Jeanty is the chosen one at the running back position. He joins Barkley, Robinson, and Zeke Elliott as one of the most highly anticipated rookie running backs to enter the league in recent memory. All of these players surged into the first round in redraft. Expect Jeanty to be selected within the top 15 picks in the NFL Draft and immediately gain ADP value. 17. Chase Brown, RB, Cincinnati, 24 Years Old Our usage king returns. Brown’s second-half run was fantastic — especially for fantasy managers rostering him. From Weeks 9–17, Brown averaged 20.6 PPG, the fifth most among all running backs. Brown had a true breakout season, going from 58 touches as a rookie to 283 in year two. The Bengals lost longtime standout running back Joe Mixon — and improved as an offense, a true testament to Brown’s impact. Expect even more in year three. 18. Drake London, WR, Atlanta Falcons, 23 Years Old London steamed up in ADP this summer, and backed it up with a WR5 overall finish. He set a career-high with 16.5 PPG and finished with 100 catches, 1271 yards, and 9 TD grabs. The sample size is small, but there is a lot of promise with Michael Penix Jr. behind center. In Penix Jr.’s three starts, London was targeted 39% of the time and had a 1st read rate of 45.1%. He will enter 2025 as a darkhorse candidate to finish as the WR1 overall. 19. Derrick Henry, RB, Baltimore Ravens, 30 Years Old OK, fine. Call me ageist. If Henry were 25 years old, I would have him ranked right up there with Gibbs. But he will be 31. Henry has shown zero signs of slowing down, and in fact, was rejuvenated in his first season in Baltimore. Henry rushed for 16 TDs and averaged 19.8 PPG — fourth overall at the running back position. I could get burned for ranking him this low. But he has to slow down at some point, right? Right? 20. Breece Hall, RB, New York Jets, 23 Years Old To some, this ranking will feel punitive. Coaching changes, coordinator changes, a big midseason trade for Davante Adams, and a whole lot of losses — this Jets season was a circus, and Hall was caught in the wreckage. Criticizing Hall is sacrilege to many in fantasy, but the facts are the facts. He only averaged 15.1 PPG, and his receiving numbers regressed from 76 receptions in 2023 to just 57 this season. Despite his immense talent, Hall has never rushed for 1,000 yards or scored more than five rushing touchdowns in any season of his career. 21. Bucky Irving, RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 22 Years Old Irving was one of the true breakout stars of the 2024 rookie class, and its top running back. He overtook the top spot in the Tampa Bay backfield from Rachaad White, 2023’s RB4 overall. Irving combines electric rushing ability (1122 rushing yards on 5.4 yards per carry) and immense potential as a receiver (47 catches for 392 yards). Let your league mates worry about Irving’s lack of NFL draft capital. Draft him everywhere you can in early redraft and best ball drafts, and trade for him in dynasty. Not to get too technical, but Irving is like that. 22. Christian McCaffrey, RB, San Francisco, 28 Years Old This will be CMC's lowest preseason ranking since his rookie season. 2024 proved to be a completely lost season for a player we have grown so accustomed to seeing dominate. San Francisco will be looking for a big turnaround, and if healthy, expect CMC to bounce back in a major way. 23. Trey McBride, TE, Arizona Cardinals, 25 Years Old McBride finished neck and neck with Bowers in PPG, outsourcing him (15.6 to 15.5) and finishing in a dead heat in receptions with Bowers slightly edging him (112-111). He led all tight ends with a 26.5% target share and finished with the fourth most receptions by a tight end in a single season - ever. The only reason more people aren’t salivating over McBride’s potential heading into 2025 is his lack of receiving touchdowns—he finished with only two. If you hate the term “positive touchdown regression,” you’ve come to the wrong place, because McBride will be the poster child for it all offseason. 24. Jonathan Taylor, RB, Indianapolis Colts, 25 Years Old I was fully prepared to leave Taylor completely out of this early Top 25 ranking, but then the fantasy playoffs happened. Taylor made up for a disappointing season—he was drafted side by side with Barkley and ahead of Achane and Henry — with two massive performances in Weeks 16 and 17. He finished as the RB1 overall in both weeks, rushing for 354 yards and 5 TDs combined. If that was not enough, Taylor had a Week 18 encore, rushing for 177 yards and another TD with most fantasy managers done for the season. 25. Kyren Williams, RB, LA Rams, 24 Years Old Tales of Williams’ demise were greatly exaggerated this preseason. There were bumps along the way and a rough patch of games late in the season, but Williams still managed to finish as an RB1 for the second consecutive season. He averaged 17.1 PPG and finished third among all running backs with 316 carries. The Blake Corum threat was largely nonexistent. There could be more challenges next season, and the Rams' offense could become even more Nacua-centric, but Williams still holds immense fantasy value as the leader in the backfield — and Corum will be coming off a broken forearm.",2025-01-06,https://www.fantasypoints.com/nfl/articles/2025/way-too-early-fantasy-football-rankings-top-25

Fantasy Football Predictions: 2025 First-Round Draft Picks,"The 2024 NFL regular season is only a few days away. Yet, there are thousands of last-minute fantasy football drafts still to go. However, it’s time to turn the page to the 2025 season. All right, it’s way too early to start working on 2025 fantasy football rankings, but let’s fast forward to nine months from now – which 12 players will be first-round fantasy football 1QB drafts next season? It’s time to fire up the crystal ball and see how the top 12 will look next year. - 2024 Fantasy Football Draft Kit - 2024 Dynasty Fantasy Football Draft Kit - 2024 Best Ball Fantasy Football Draft Kit - Free Fantasy Football Mock Draft Simulator Projecting 2025 First-Round Fantasy Football Draft Picks Pick 1.01 – Justin Jefferson (WR – MIN) Many were afraid to draft Jefferson as the 1.01 pick because of his quarterback. Kirk Cousins is in Atlanta, and J.J. McCarthy is out for the year, leaving Sam Darnold as the starter in 2024. While Darnold isn’t an ideal fantasy quarterback, the veteran can get Jefferson the ball. Last year, the superstar receiver averaged 18.4 half-point PPR fantasy points per game in the final four games with Nick Mullens. With McCarthy likely the starter for Week 1 in 2025, Jefferson should be a popular 1.01 pick. Pick 1.02 – Breece Hall (RB – NYJ) Hall was the RB32 over the first four weeks last season, averaging 6.9 half-point PPR fantasy points per game. However, he was unstoppable once the Jets took him off the snap count. The superstar was the RB2 from Week 5 through Week 18, averaging 17.3 fantasy points per game. Furthermore, Hall was outstanding despite playing on one of the NFL’s worst offenses. New York vastly improved their offensive line in the offseason. Don’t be surprised if Hall has a Christian McCaffrey-like season and becomes the clear-cut RB1 in 2025. Pick 1.03 – Bijan Robinson (RB – ATL) Atlanta should have a significantly better offense after adding Kirk Cousins in free agency. More importantly, Arthur Smith is gone, meaning Robinson will have a featured role this season. Fantasy players rightfully hate Smith for giving Robinson only 28 more rushing attempts than Tyler Allgeier despite averaging 0.9 more yards per attempt. The Falcons have one of the top offensive lines in the NFL and a bright, up-and-coming offensive coordinator in Zac Robinson. The former Texas star will bounce back after a disappointing rookie season. Pick 1.04 – CeeDee Lamb (WR – DAL) The only way Lamb isn’t a top-four pick in 2025 fantasy football drafts is if Dak Prescott isn’t playing for the Cowboys. However, fantasy players should expect Dallas and the star quarterback to get a long-term deal over the next few months. Lamb was outstanding last season despite the slow start, averaging 102.9 receiving yards and 19.7 half-point PPR fantasy points per game. Unless the Cowboys make a blockbuster move for a wide receiver, Lamb should be a top-five fantasy pick for the next several years. Pick 1.05 – Ja’Marr Chase (WR – CIN) While fantasy players might be nervous about drafting Chase this year because of his contract holdout, the Bengals and the superstar should have a long-term extension worked out before next season. The former LSU star has one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL. Despite playing half the year with Jake Browning, the superstar receiver totaled over 1,000 receiving yards and at least seven receiving touchdowns for the third consecutive season. More importantly, Tee Higgins likely won’t be back in Cincinnati in 2025, creating more target opportunities for Chase. Pick 1.06 – Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR – ARI) Harrison has massive expectations despite never playing a regular-season snap in the NFL. The former Ohio State star is an elite talent, putting up over 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns in back-to-back years to end his college career. The rookie should see double-digit targets per game as Kyler Murray’s clear-cut No. 1 wide receiver in 2024. Arizona will likely spend most of their 2025 draft capital on improving their awful defense, giving Harrison a clear pathway to a massive target share again next season. Pick 1.07 – Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR – DET) The safest first-round pick this year is St. Brown. While the former USC star doesn’t have the same upside as Justin Jefferson, CeeDee Lamb, or Ja’Marr Chase, he has been the most consistent fantasy wide receiver since the end of his rookie season. St. Brown was the WR2 over the final six games as a rookie, the WR8 in 2022, and the WR3 last year, averaging 17 half-point PPR fantasy points per game. The star receiver plays in a fantasy-friendly offense with a quarterback who loves to target him. Pick 1.08 – Christian McCaffrey (RB – SF) Many will be shocked to see where I predict McCaffrey will come off the board in 2025. Some think the superstar will struggle with injuries this season and see his fantasy value tank. Others believe McCaffrey will put up another RB1 finish this year. The veteran will be 29 years old heading into next year after likely totaling over 325 touches for the third consecutive season. The 49ers could draft a big-name rookie to be the heir apparent to McCaffrey, which will impact his fantasy outlook in 2025. Pick 1.09 – Garrett Wilson (WR – NYJ) Wilson was a popular breakout candidate last year after the Jets traded for Aaron Rodgers. Unfortunately, the future Hall of Famer lasted four snaps before tearing his Achilles, leaving the former Ohio State star to catch passes from Zach Wilson. Thankfully, that won’t happen in 2024. While Wilson likely won’t have a top-three finish, the star receiver could be a bargain as his early-second round ADP. The only way he isn’t a top-10 pick in 2025 is if Rodgers retires and the Jets fail to give Wilson an adequate replacement. Pick 1.10 – Jonathan Taylor (RB – IND) Unfortunately, Taylor has struggled with injuries over the past few years. The superstar missed seven games in 2024 with ankle and thumb injuries. Yet, he averaged 18.7 half-point PPR fantasy points per game over his final four healthy contests. Some are worried Anthony Richardson will impact Taylor’s rushing touchdown upside. However, the Colts will want to limit his rushing production and protect him after he missed 13 games as a rookie. Expect Taylor to be a top-10 pick in 2025 if he can stay healthy this season. Pick 1.11 – A.J. Brown (WR – PHI) The former Ole Miss star has been one of the more consistent fantasy receivers since getting traded to Philadelphia. Brown was the WR5 in 2022, averaging 15 half-point PPR fantasy points per game. While the Eagles offense struggled last year, the veteran finished as the WR7, averaging 13.9 fantasy points per game despite seeing a 36.4% decline in receiving touchdowns. New offensive coordinator Kellen Moore should help Brown and DeVonta Smith’s fantasy value. However, the expected breakout season from Smith likely keeps Brown from being a top-10 pick in 2025. Pick 1.12 – Malik Nabers (WR – NYG) Is calling Nabers a top-12 pick in 2025 fantasy football drafts a hot take? Probably, but don’t be surprised if that happens. The rookie is the only difference maker the Giants have on offense and could see double-digit targets per game this season. The argument against Nabers being a top-12 wide receiver as a rookie is his awful quarterback situation, as Daniel Jones is the worst starting quarterback in the NFL. Thankfully, the Giants can move on from Jones in the offseason, giving Nabers a respectable starting quarterback next year. Mike Fanelli is a featured writer at FantasyPros.

Fantasy football 2025: Top 10 WR values,"Our look at the best fantasy values by position heading into the 2025 NFL season continues with wide receivers. The projected draft position listed for each player is based on 12-team league formats with PPR scoring. NOTE: Average draft position was pulled from FantasyPros.com at 1 p.m. ET on July 29. Projected draft position: Round 8 (WR42) It isn’t the sexiest pick, but Meyers sneakily eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards and finished last season as the WR23 in average fantasy points per game (14.5, per FantasyPros.com). He did this while playing with a mishmash of quarterbacks (Aidan O’Connell, Gardner Minshew and Desmond Ridder). Now he will catch passes from veteran Geno Smith, who should be able to lead the offense to much more success. Meyers saw 129 targets last season despite missing two games, and I expect his target volume to remain high this year. Based on this projection, fantasy managers can grab a guy who could receive 140-plus targets in the eighth round. That's a great deal. Projected draft position: Round 12 or later (WR53) The Chargers' second-round pick is already making waves in training camp and very well could be a starter in Week 1. Ladd McConkey will again lead this team in targets, but Harris has a strong opportunity to be Justin Herbert’s second-most-targeted receiver this season. McConkey mostly dominated the slot, but Harris could lead the Bolts in outside targets in his rookie season. His biggest competition in that area is Quentin Johnston, who has struggled to be a reliable weapon over his first two NFL seasons. Harris won't need many targets to be fantasy relevant if he brings his big-play prowess to the NFL; he averaged 17.7 yards per reception over the last two seasons at Ole Miss (most by any player in the FBS during that span, min. 100 rec.). Projected draft position: Round 5 (WR25) Worthy finished his 2024 rookie season as just the WR45 on average (11.0 PPG) due to a slow start. However, in the second half of the season, he showed his potential as a great fantasy asset. From Week 11 through the Super Bowl, Worthy posted 17.5 fantasy points per game after averaging just 8.7 points in Weeks 1-10. That increase in production emphasized Patrick Mahomes' trust in Worthy, which could lead to more targets in 2025. Plus, Travis Kelce is entering his age-36 season, while Rashee Rice, who's returning from injury, could be suspended after pleading guilty to two felonies. Projected draft position: Rounds 5-6 (WR27) The 2022 first-round pick squarely found his footing in Year 3. He thrived when given the opportunity last season, averaging 17.3 fantasy points per game in the nine games in which he had at least six targets. For perspective, that was more points than Mike Evans, Brian Thomas Jr., A.J. Brown and Drake London averaged over the course of the season. Jared Goff and the team trusted Williams more and more as the 2024 campaign progressed; the speedy wideout received at least six targets in seven of the last eight regular-season games. Projected draft position: Rounds 6-7 (WR32) It took five years, but Jeudy finally lived up to his potential after entering the league in 2020 as the No. 15 overall pick. In his first year with the Browns, Jeudy recorded the first 1,000-yard season of his pro career with 1,229 yards. He finished as the WR12 in total fantasy points ... but sits as the WR32 in average draft position for the coming season. That feels far too low for a player who averaged 101 receiving yards and 16.2 fantasy points per game during the back half of the season (Weeks 11-18). Yes, the Browns' QB situation is a mess -- with four guys competing for the starting job -- but Jeudy undoubtedly will be the go-to target, regardless of who's under center. If Joe Flacco wins the job, Jeudy could be a weekly top-10 producer. Projected draft position: Rounds 5-6 (WR28) Hunter is walking into an ideal situation in Jacksonville with a ton of available work; the Jaguars have 153 vacated targets from 2024 after moving on from veterans Christian Kirk, Gabe Davis and Evan Engram this offseason. The main reason Hunter is projected to go in the fifth or sixth round is because he's expected to split snaps at wide receiver and cornerback. However, he had no issues playing both positions full time at Colorado -- averaging an astounding 111.5 snaps per game over the past two seasons -- and he was extremely productive, as well. In 2024, Hunter caught 96 balls for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns. Three rookies finished inside the top 12 receivers in fantasy points last season: Brian Thomas Jr., Malik Nabers and Ladd McConkey. At his WR28 draft slot, Hunter has the opportunity to be a league-winning pick this year. Projected draft position: Rounds 8-9 (WR45) One year after getting shot in the chest during an attempted robbery, San Francisco's 2024 first-rounder finds himself in a prime situation to showcase his talents to be a true WR1 in the league. The 49ers traded Deebo Samuel to the Commanders. Meanwhile, Brandon Aiyuk could miss some time while recovering from an ACL tear, and Jauan Jennings, who views himself as a No. 1 receiver, is seeking a new deal from the team. Pearsall missed the first six weeks of his rookie season while recovering from the gunshot wound and took some time to get his bearings upon return. However, he finished strong, racking up 14 catches for 210 yards and two touchdowns in Weeks 17 and 18. In the three games in which he saw at least six targets, Pearsall averaged 21.6 fantasy points, scoring at least 17 points in each contest. Pearsall has the upside to be a top-15 fantasy WR this season. Projected draft position: Rounds 1-2 (WR7) It is rare that a player being drafted in the top 15 picks is considered a “value,” but Collins should not be the seventh wide receiver off the board. Last season, Nico put up over 1,000 receiving yards and seven touchdowns despite missing five games. (Projecting his production over 17 games, you get 140 targets, 96 catches, 1,425 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns.) From Weeks 1-5, Collins averaged 113.4 receiving yards and 21.3 fantasy points per game -- only Ja’Marr Chase scored more fantasy points than Collins during that span. Unfortunately, his performance dropped off dramatically after he suffered a hamstring injury in Week 5. A healthy Collins, who is expected to see a large target share with so many new faces joining the Texans' passing attack, has the upside to finish as the overall WR1 in 2025. Projected draft position: Rounds 4-5 (WR22) It has been several years since Metcalf rewarded fantasy players who drafted him. Now he finds himself with a new team and with a future Hall of Fame quarterback in Aaron Rodgers. Metcalf’s skill set is a perfect match for the veteran quarterback, with both players excelling deep down the field and in the end zone. Metcalf has the fifth-most receiving touchdowns since 2020, and his average of 16.0 yards per reception since 2023 ranks third in the NFL among all players with at least 100 receptions. Per Next Gen Stats, Rodgers tied for the NFL lead with nine deep passing touchdowns (20-plus air yards) in 2024. Metcalf should be peppered with balls in this Steelers offense, as there is very little competition for targets after Pittsburgh traded George Pickens to Dallas. Last season, Metcalf averaged 14.8 fantasy points in the 10 games in which he had at least six targets. Projected draft position: Round 3 (WR12) Hill was regularly drafted as a top-three pick in 2024 fantasy drafts and has now fallen all the way to Round 3 after one down campaign. By average points per week, Hill was the WR33 last season after being the WR2 in 2023 and WR3 in '22. There are several ways to interpret his 2024 downturn. Hill, who posted his first sub-1,000-yard campaign since 2019, turned 30 before last season. Meanwhile, injuries to both himself and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa held the receiver back. I choose to believe the latter factor -- which is more random -- is the more pertinent one. Hill played through a wrist injury all season -- for which he underwent a pair of procedures during this offseason -- but still performed well when targeted by Tagovailoa, who missed six games to injury. Hill averaged just 12.8 fantasy points per game overall in 2024, but he posted 21.2 points per contest when he had at least eight targets from Tagovailoa. If Miami's QB1 can stay healthy in 2025, I fully expect Hill -- an absolute steal in the third round -- to get back to putting up big-time numbers.",2025-07-29,https://www.nfl.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-top-10-wr-values
Top-5 Fantasy Football Draft Rankings: Elite First-Round Player Outlooks (2025),"Joey Pollizze's fantasy football rankings for the top 5 player in 2025. His outlooks and draft advice for elite first-round draft picks, including Ja'Marr Chase and more. We are around two months away from most fantasy football drafts taking place in late August. With training camp starting next month and preseason games beginning a few weeks after that, the fantasy football season will be here before we know it. Therefore, now is a great time to start looking at where certain players are going in drafts. In this article, we will determine what the top five picks should look like in fantasy drafts. All five of these players were fantasy superstars last season, and that should continue into the 2025-26 campaign. So, who should the top five picks be in 2025 fantasy football drafts? Let's dive in and find out. Be sure to check all of our fantasy football rankings for 2025:- 2025 fantasy football rankings - Running back (RB) fantasy football rankings - Wide receiver (WR) fantasy football rankings - Tight end (TE) fantasy football rankings - Quarterback (QB) fantasy football rankings - Defense (D/ST) fantasy football rankings - NFL rookie fantasy football rankings - Best ball fantasy football rankings - Superflex fantasy football rankings - Dynasty fantasy football rankings 5. WR Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson kicks off this list at No. 5. Jefferson is coming off another dominant fantasy season in which he finished as the WR2 in PPR formats. He totaled 103 catches for 1,533 yards and 10 touchdowns and averaged 18.7 PPR fantasy points per game with Sam Darnold under center. Jefferson was a spectacular fantasy wide receiver last year, scoring above 20 PPR fantasy points in eight of 17 games. He didn't have many poor performances and helped many fantasy managers reach the championship after he scored a season-high 36.4 PPR fantasy points in Week 16 against the Seattle Seahawks. Therefore, the Vikings wideout is an easy top-5 pick in fantasy drafts. Most receiving yards in a WR’s first: 5 seasons - Justin Jefferson 4 seasons - Justin Jefferson 3 seasons - Justin Jefferson 2 seasons - Justin JeffersonLeBron type numbers. pic.twitter.com/OrENJg7KdA — SleeperNFL (@SleeperNFL) June 9, 2025 Even with J.J. McCarthy starting for the Vikings in what will be his first season, Jefferson is a safe pick in this spot. He is widely regarded as one of the best wide receivers in the game and will dominate no matter who his quarterback is. The 26-year-old has caught at least 100 passes and totaled over 1,500 receiving yards in three of his past four seasons. It will be interesting to see how Jefferson fares with a ""rookie"" under center, which is why he is a bit lower than the consensus on this list. Jefferson has a 2.5 ADP on ESPN, a 3.0 ADP on Yahoo, and a 3.2 ADP on Sleeper. Still, he is a fantastic pick in the first round and will likely finish as a top-3 fantasy wideout for the third time in four years. 4. RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Detroit Lions Jefferson should be in consideration for pick No. 4, but it's tough to pass on Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs following his incredible sophomore campaign. Gibbs ran the ball 250 times for 1,412 yards and 16 touchdowns while catching 52 passes for 517 yards and four touchdowns through the air. Those numbers helped Gibbs finish as the overall RB1 in PPR formats. With Saquon Barkley sitting out the final game, the Lions running back overtook him for that top finish after scoring 46 PPR fantasy points in Week 18 against the Minnesota Vikings. That capped off an unbelievable fantasy season for the 23-year-old in which he averaged 21.4 PPR fantasy points across 17 contests. There's no denying that Gibbs was one of the best fantasy running backs in 2024. Although he split almost evenly with David Montgomery, the superstar back scored above 19 PPR fantasy points in 10 of 17 games, including in seven of the final eight contests. As a result, the Pro Bowler is a great pick at 1.04 in all formats. He should continue to have a large role in this Detroit offense, and his receiving upside makes him an even better target in PPR formats. Some might point to the loss of offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as a reason Gibbs should drop in drafts. However, his fantasy value really shouldn't be affected too much. The talent is still there, with the potential to see over 300 touches in 2025. 3. RB Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles Barkley just had one of the best running back seasons we have seen in recent years. He rushed for 2,005 yards and had a chance to break Eric Dickerson's 2,105-yard rushing record set back in 1984. However, the Eagles decided to sit him in the final week to keep him fresh for the playoffs. Barkley was truly unstoppable behind Philadelphia's offensive line in 2024. His overall numbers helped him finish as the RB2 in PPR formats and the RB1 in average fantasy points per game (22.2). He also had plenty of big fantasy performances, scoring over 32 PPR fantasy points on five different occasions. So, he should be a top-3 pick in fantasy drafts. Saquon Barkley: “I feel like I’m entering my prime.” pic.twitter.com/VFuJihz4ju — Zach Berman (@ZBerm) June 10, 2025 Now, the biggest reason why Barkley is not No. 1 or No. 2 on this list is that there are some health concerns following a heavy workload. The Eagles running back handled 482 touches last season (including playoffs), which ranks tied for 10th all-time. We have also seen a ton of running backs not repeat these incredible seasons after handling such a large workload the previous year. Christian McCaffrey totaled 417 touches in 2023 and played in just four games the next season. Josh Jacobs handled 393 touches in 2022 and missed four games the next year. Derrick Henry saw 418 touches in 2020 and played in only eight games the ensuing year. While there could be some injury risks with Barkley, he is still a top-3 selection. 2. RB Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons There's a strong argument that Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson deserves to go No. 1 overall in fantasy drafts. He just finished as the RB3 in PPR formats, averaged 20.1 PPR fantasy points per game, and saw a whopping 365 touches in 2024. That all makes him an easy selection early in drafts. Robinson rushed for 1,456 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground last season and caught 61 passes for 431 yards and one touchdown through the air. The Falcons running back was also one of the best fantasy options from Week 6 onward, as he averaged 22.8 PPR fantasy points in the final 12 weeks. Only Ja'Marr Chase averaged more PPR fantasy points (24.6) during this span among all non-quarterbacks. Therefore, fantasy managers can't go wrong with Robinson early in drafts. He'll continue to see a high volume of touches and will receive most of the carries out of this Atlanta backfield. The 2024 Pro Bowler had a 79% average snap share in the final nine weeks of the 2024 season. He is an ideal target at No. 2. 1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals It's not surprising that Chase will be the 1.01 in most drafts this season. He just finished as the overall WR1 and was one of just two players to score over 400 PPR fantasy points last year. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was the other. The Bengals wideout scored a whopping 403 PPR fantasy points while averaging 23.7 PPR fantasy points per game. Chase was easily the best fantasy wide receiver last season. He scored over 40 PPR fantasy points in three separate games (Week 5, Week 10, and Week 14) and had many solid fantasy performances as well. The four-time Pro Bowler scored at least 19 PPR fantasy points in 10 of 17 games. Given that he is coming off a 127-catch, 1,708-yard, 17-touchdown campaign, he should be drafted No. 1 overall. The #Bengals open camp in 36 days. I’m counting down with a daily observation. After winning the Triple Crown and earning a $161 million extension, what’s Ja’Marr Chase aiming for next? “Winning a championship. That’s all I can think about. I wanna win. That’s why I’m here.” pic.twitter.com/UfgGbwSXwo— Dan Hoard (@Dan_Hoard) June 18, 2025 The 25-year-old will remain the top option for quarterback Joe Burrow in Cincinnati's offense while likely seeing another 165-plus target season. That's because Burrow might have to continue airing it out with the team failing to upgrade its defense in the offseason. That unit ranked 24th overall last season, and star edge-rusher Trey Hendrickson could hold out if he doesn't get a new contract. So, you should be in on Chase once again in 2025. Let's just hope the Bengals wideout doesn't fall into the No. 1 overall pick curse. Jonathan Taylor (2022), Jefferson (2023), and McCaffrey (2024) all busted after being the consensus 1.01 in fantasy drafts in those years.

Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers from NFL computer that called James Cook's productive year,"Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers from NFL computer that called James Cook's productive year SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep The NFL regular season might still be weeks away, but 2025 Fantasy football drafts are right around the corner. Depth chart battles are taking place across the NFL, which can impact your 2025 Fantasy football strategy. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco is slotted in as the expected starter, but he is coming off a broken leg and will be an injury risk this season. If he is unable to take on a full workload, the battle between backups Kareem Hunt and Elijah Mitchell could come into play. Hunt had 788 rushing yards and seven touchdowns last season, while Mitchell spent the entire 2024 campaign on the injured reserve. Should you include either of those potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers in your Fantasy football lineups? Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Bills running back James Cook would comfortably outperform his ADP (RB14). The result: Cook rushed for 1,009 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 32 receptions for 258 yards and two more scores as a receiver. He finished as RB8 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and his maturation into a scoring threat cemented his status as a Fantasy football superstar. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Vikings tight end T.J. Hockenson. The veteran missed the first half of the 2024 campaign due to a torn ACL, but he was a solid contributor once he returned. Hockenson finished with 41 receptions for 455 yards in 10 games, averaging 11.1 yards per reception. He added a postseason touchdown and was pacing for top-eight Fantasy numbers among 2024 tight ends, so he should jump back near the top of his position rankings with a clean bill of health this year. Hockenson did not score in the regular season, despite drawing eight red zone targets. Positive touchdown variance is one reason why the model has Hockenson ranked ahead of tight ends like Jonnu Smith and Taysom Hill, who are getting drafted before him in average Fantasy drafts. Another sleeper that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: Bears wide receiver DJ Moore. A reliable playmaker, Moore has recorded four 1,000-yard seasons in his career and totaled 194 receptions for 2,300 yards and 15 touchdowns in his first two years with the Bears. Despite being a known commodity, Moore's sleeper potential in 2025 stems from Chicago's offensive overhaul, which could unlock his ceiling in new ways. The Bears' quarterback situation has stabilized with the arrival of No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams, whose elite arm talent and mobility offer a significant upgrade at the position. Moore has already shown the ability to thrive with subpar quarterback play, and if Williams adjusts quickly to the NFL, Moore could be in line for a breakout campaign. Another major part of the Bears' transformation comes from their hiring of former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as head coach. Known for his creativity and success developing explosive offenses in Detroit, Johnson is expected to bring a more aggressive and modern scheme to Chicago. See which other Fantasy football sleepers 2025 to pick here. How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a veteran wide receiver to surprise with his production. The model says this wideout is a shocking top-10 option ahead of younger stars like A.J. Brown and Drake London. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine. So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers should you target? And which wide receiver shocks the NFL with a top-10 performance?

"Fantasy football 2025: Justin Fields, Caleb Williams among breakout candidates","With the thick of fantasy draft season approaching, I recently provided my top 10 values at running back and tight end. I offered my top 10 league-winners, too. While there was a little bit of overlap, I tried to avoid writing about the same players here, so make sure to read those pieces as well. Now, on to my leading breakout candidates! QUARTERBACK Don't sweat the concerning August headlines; Fields is my guy this season. The Jets are clearly built to run the ball, and that should help Fields -- one of just three NFL QBs ever to post a 1,000-yard rushing season -- reach his full fantasy potential. Expect a lot of outside-zone runs, which play exactly to Fields' strength. Not only that, but new Jets offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand spent the past five seasons on the Lions' coaching staff. If his offense operates like Detroit's did during his time there, I expect Fields won't be asked to air it out as much as he was in Chicago, and that he will instead be expected to complete shorter passes, like he did last year in Pittsburgh, when he posted his best career metrics as a passer. In his six starts with the Steelers, Fields generated 18.89 fantasy points per game; if he'd kept at that pace over 17 games, he would have finished with the seventh-most fantasy points among QBs. He could potentially exceed that in the Jets' offense this year. Williams was the big winner of the offseason. The Bears rebuilt the interior of their offensive line, acquiring Joe Thuney, Drew Dalman and Jonah Jackson. They added one of the best play-callers around, new head coach Ben Johnson. And they brough in more weapons (rookies Colston Loveland and Luther Burden III) to join DJ Moore, Rome Odunze and D'Andre Swift. A similar build in Detroit helped take Jared Goff to new heights, both in real life and as a fantasy QB, and Williams is just one year removed from being drafted first overall and dubbed a generational prospect. He still brings a ton of upside and should become the first Bears QB to top 4,000 passing yards in a season this year. Plus, he is a sneaky good runner, having tallied nearly 500 yards on the ground in 2024. I went on Fantasy Live last season to talk up Maye every chance I could. His 2024 stats might not jump off the page, but if you watched him play, you saw that he has the ability to be the next great fantasy QB, with a strong arm and true playmaking talent. Plus, he is mobile and can pick up sneaky points with his legs, a skill he has alluded to in the preseason. The Patriots improved their offensive line, bringing in Will Campbell, Jared Wilson, Garrett Bradbury and Morgan Moses, and they made additions to Maye's cast of weapons, draftingTreVeyon Henderson and Kyle Williams, each of whom carries upside in their own right. The only concern I have for Maye is that the Patriots will not throw enough; otherwise, the breakout potential is clear to see. RUNNING BACK Harvey fell to a fantastic landing spot with Sean Payton in Denver. Since 2011, the lead pass-catching back for Payton’s teams has averaged 81 targets per season. His top pass-catching RB failed to reach 60 targets just three times in that span, but that was because two backs each topped 50 targets in those years. In other words, Payton’s offense throws to RBs at a very high rate! Not only is Harvey a strong receiver, he is a shifty runner with good speed and should produce a bunch of chunk plays. During my 2025 NFL Draft prep I projected a Bucky Irving-like ceiling for Harvey. I love targeting him as a RB2 in the middle rounds of drafts. Johnson is a big, powerful back who could thrive in Arthur Smith’s run-heavy system. Smith’s offenses have finished among the top four in rushing attempts in three straight seasons. Johnson could fill the void left by Najee Harris, who had 299 touches in 2024, and Johnson is the more explosive runner right now. His college tape is littered with big plays. Imagine Harris with all that volume and a Mario Kart mushroom boost. That is what Johnson could be in the Steelers’ offense. He’s being drafted as a RB3 right now, but he could easily exceed that value. Mason seemingly came out of nowhere last year and ended up flirting with RB1 fantasy status while Christian McCaffrey was sidelined due to injury. Mason showed he belongs by leading all backs in missed tackles forced rate (37 percent) and finishing second in explosive run rate (15 percent of carries went for 10-plus yards). He was traded in the offseason but remains in a fantasy-friendly system with the Vikings. We are already hearing talk from camp that suggests Mason and Aaron Jones could split ground work. Plus, Jones will turn 31 in December and has played in every game only three times in his eight-year career. Mason will once again flirt with RB1 value if Jones misses time. Blue is a deeper cut (currently the RB45 in ADP, per FantasyPros), but he’s still a breakout candidate I like. He has great speed, which he showed at the NFL Scouting Combine (4.38-second 40-yard dash). That speed and the ability to cut quickly stood out when I watched his college tape. He’s a weapon out of the backfield as a receiver, too. He reminded me of 2010 first-round pick C.J. Spiller when I was watching his film. Now, Blue will have to beat out Javonte Williams and (an already banged up) Miles Sanders for the Cowboys RB1 job. Williams is the bigger threat, but he has not looked the same since his knee injury a couple years ago. He struggled as a runner and averaged the fourth-fewest yards per target of all running backs last year. Blue has the juice and could quickly steal the lead gig in Dallas. Go get him in the later rounds of your drafts! WIDE RECEIVER Ridley has long been a favorite of mine. You might be wondering what he’s doing on this list, considering he has three 1,000-yard seasons under his belt, reaching the mark in each of the last two years. Well, I believe the last two seasons were a major disservice to him. First, Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars offense did not live up to expectations in 2023, when TE Evan Engram saw more targets than Ridley. Then last year he had to deal with the Titans’ QB woes. Ridley is the clear-cut top target for Tennessee now and he has a potential QB upgrade in first overall pick Cam Ward. Last season Ridley had the third-highest rate of uncatchable targets, but he led all receivers in air yards per target. It was very volatile usage and he set a career-low in fantasy PPG, yet he still finished as a WR3, which is the price he’s going for this year. There is nowhere to go but up for him and the big season we have been waiting for still remains on the table. Hunter was a favorite of mine (and many others) leading up to this year’s draft. As the 2024 Heisman Trophy winner’s college tape shows, he’s an elite talent who can win down the field and after the catch. I am continuing to operate under the assumption Hunter will primarily play wide receiver. The Jaguars are honoring his wish to take snaps on both sides of the ball. I hope he succeeds in this endeavor -- which would make him a unicorn by modern-era standards -- though we know there are skeptics around the league. Hunter should see his share of favorable coverage playing opposite Brian Thomas Jr., who is coming off a 1,282-yard, 10-touchdown rookie year. Talent tends to win out in this league and Hunter has the upside to easily outperform his WR3 draft cost. As you can see, I am in on Chiefs wide receivers this year. Last season, Patrick Mahomes had the fewest air yards per attempt (6.3) of any QB who threw at least 400 passes. That should never be the case in Kansas City. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy has said there’s a focus on getting the deep ball back into the team’s offense. Mahomes still has it, as we saw in Super Bowl LIX with his touchdown throw to Worthy. In 2024, Rice was on pace for a breakout year until a knee injury ended his season in Week 4. He has been practicing with the team, but he’s currently dealing with a groin injury and the possibility of a suspension looms after Rice was sentenced to 30 days in jail for his role in a high-speed car crash last year. If he’s healthy and clear to play for the bulk of the season, I still expect a breakout performance from him. Worthy really flashed down the stretch last season. He’s going as a WR3 in fantasy drafts, which could prove to be a steal. Brown remains a great field stretcher when healthy. He’s dealt with an ankle injury in camp and is going outside the top 50 WRs in most leagues. I view that as a pure buying opportunity. Pearsall had to overcome a horrific situation in his transition to the NFL, as he suffered a gunshot wound to his chest in an attempted robbery last August. Miraculously, his injury was not serious enough to keep him out for very long. After making his debut in mid-October and getting some time to settle in, he really flashed his upside. Pearsall averaged 15-plus fantasy PPG in games where he was targeted at least five times. He can line up all over the field, which makes him a very dangerous weapon in Kyle Shanahan’s system. I like the 49ers’ top WRs this year, as they are all strong values, but I’m especially fond of Pearsall at the price of a WR4. Coleman is the upside play in the Bills passing attack. He flashed as a potential breakout before a mid-November wrist injury sidelined him for four weeks. He didn’t look the same when he returned for the final month of the regular season, which opened the door for Amari Cooper, whom Buffalo traded for before the midseason deadline, to get more opportunities. Coleman has shown the ability to win downfield and in the red zone in camp; not surprising after he led the team in end zone targets in 2024. A high touchdown output is very much in play for Coleman this season, especially with reigning MVP Josh Allen running the offense. There is too much upside surrounding Coleman to pass over his average draft price (WR49, per FantasyPros).",2025-08-07,https://www.nfl.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-breakout-candidates
Top 10 Fantasy Football Players 2025: Early Rankings,"Top 10 Fantasy Football players 2025 Your Ultimate Guide to Dominating Fantasy Football 2025 Fantasy football never sleeps! Whether you’re waiting for the NFL playoffs to conclude or gearing up for your league’s draft, it’s time to start strategizing for 2025. These early rankings set the foundation for a championship-winning season. Dive into our analysis of the Top 10 Fantasy Football Players for 2025 and stay ahead of your competition! This list will change, but it’s never too early to start laying it out. Top 10 Players - Bijan Robinson - Jahmyr Gibbs - Saquon Barkley - Ashton Jeanty - Kyren Williams - Justin Jefferson - Ja’Marr Chase - Derrick Henry - Breece Hall - Brian Thomas Jr 10. Brian Thomas Jr. Brian Thomas Jr. makes our list as a young, dynamic wide receiver poised for another breakout year. With 87 receptions, 1,282 yards, and 10 touchdowns in 2024, his upside is undeniable. Although regression is a concern, his elite target share ensures he remains a top 10 option. Key Stats (2024): - 133 Targets - Fourth Among Wide Receivers in fantasy points in 2024 9. Breece Hall Breece Hall had a down year in 2024, finishing 16th among running backs. But as he moves further away from his knee injury, expect a major bounce-back season. With the Jets poised to improve their offense, Hall is a strong candidate to surpass his 876 rushing yards and 5 touchdowns. 2025 Outlook: Hall’s volume will climb, making him a value pick in early drafts. He has to bounce back, and there is really no way but up for Breece the Beast Hall! 8. Derrick Henry The King remains in the conversation, even at age 31. After a stellar 2024 season with 1,921 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns, can Henry defy Father Time once again? His workload remains massive, but wear-and-tear and potential regression are red flags. Fantasy Tip: Monitor the Ravens offseason moves before investing heavily in Henry. Also, a possible Super Bowl Hang over could linger if the Ravens go deep into the NFL playoffs. 7. Ja’marr Chase With 1,700 yards and 17 touchdowns, Chase finished as the WR1 in 2024. While maintaining this production is challenging, his chemistry with Joe Burrow is unmatched. Expect him to remain a first-round pick, but be cautious of regression. 6. Justin Jefferson The definition of consistency, Jefferson’s 154 targets and 1,317 yards in 2024 kept him among the elite. Safe and reliable, he’s a must-have for those prioritizing wide receivers early. Pro Tip: Pair Jefferson with value running backs in later rounds to maximize roster balance. 5. Kyren Williams Williams continues to fly under the radar despite finishing seventh among running backs in 2024. With 316 attempts and 1,299 yards, he proved he’s a true workhorse. Look for even more upside in 2025 as he becomes a focal point of his offense. Kyren really proved that he is the main man in LA, and he continues to get better each year. Barring injury he is going 4. Ashton Jeanty The incoming rookie is generating buzz, with comparisons to Barry Sanders thanks to his patience, explosiveness, and vision. If Jeanty lands in a favorable situation—like Dallas—he could easily dominate in his first year. Key College Stats: - 374 Attempts - 29 Touchdowns last season 3. Saquon Barkley After an incredible 2,005-yard season, Saquon faces inevitable regression. While his talent and opportunity remain elite, it’s tough to expect another historic season. Monitor the Giants’ offseason moves and his usage in the playoffs. It was very disapointing that the Eagles decided to sit Barkley in a game that could have etched his name in the history books. He will never get another chance to ever get close to Dickerson’s Record. Let along break this record of 2105 rushing yards in a a season. I am projecting a decline for Saquon in 2025! 2. Jahmyr Gibbs Gibbs showcased his versatility and explosiveness in 2024, finishing as one of the top running backs despite sharing work with David Montgomery. If Montgomery departs, Gibbs has RB1 overall upside. Fantasy Tip: Draft Gibbs confidently, especially if his workload increases. Montgomery will be a pest, but if he gets hurt again, look for Gibbs to put up historical numbers. 1. Bijan Robinson No surprise here—Bijan Robinson tops our rankings as the ultimate fantasy workhorse. With 304 carries, 1,500+ yards, and no competition in the Falcons’ backfield, Robinson is a can’t-miss first-round pick. Why Bijan? - Volume: Workhorse usage with 300+ carries. - Opportunity: No committee backfield. - Youth: At 23, he’s just hitting his prime.

Last year, the model accurately predicted that Bills running back James Cook would comfortably outperform his ADP (RB14). The result: Cook rushed for 1,009 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 32 receptions for 258 yards and two more scores as a receiver. He finished as RB8 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and his maturation into a scoring threat cemented his status as a Fantasy football superstar. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football rankings 2025, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Vikings tight end T.J. Hockenson. The veteran missed the first half of the 2024 campaign due to a torn ACL, but he was a solid contributor once he returned. Hockenson finished with 41 receptions for 455 yards in 10 games, averaging 11.1 yards per reception. He added a postseason touchdown and was pacing for top-eight Fantasy numbers among 2024 tight ends, so he should jump back near the top of his position rankings with a clean bill of health this year. Hockenson did not score in the regular season, despite drawing eight red zone targets. Positive touchdown variance is one reason why the model has Hockenson ranked ahead of tight ends like Jonnu Smith and Taysom Hill, who are getting drafted before him in average Fantasy drafts. Another sleeper that SportsLine's Fantasy football rankings 2025 have identified: Bears wide receiver DJ Moore. A reliable playmaker, Moore has recorded four 1,000-yard seasons in his career and totaled 194 receptions for 2,300 yards and 15 touchdowns in his first two years with the Bears. Despite being a known commodity, Moore's sleeper potential in 2025 stems from Chicago's offensive overhaul, which could unlock his ceiling in new ways. The Bears' quarterback situation has stabilized with the arrival of No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams, whose elite arm talent and mobility offer a significant upgrade at the position. Moore has already shown the ability to thrive with subpar quarterback play, and if Williams adjusts quickly to the NFL, Moore could be in line for a breakout campaign. Another major part of the Bears' transformation comes from their hiring of former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as head coach. Known for his creativity and success developing explosive offenses in Detroit, Johnson is expected to bring a more aggressive and modern scheme to Chicago.

"Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year","Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year SportsLine simulated the new NFL season 10,000 times and identified 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts for upcoming drafts Raiders tight end Brock Bowers is coming off the most prolific season for a rookie tight end in NFL history after catching 112 passes for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns. He was first-team All-Pro despite playing with three different starting quarterbacks, and there's optimism that the offseason additions of Geno Smith and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty will only aid his production. Where exactly should you be targeting Bowers in your upcoming 2025 Fantasy football drafts? Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren were top 14 picks at tight end in the 2025 NFL Draft as Bowers was last year, but is either ready to slot into your Fantasy football lineups this season? A reliable set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer those questions and also identify potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts before you go on the clock. A reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer that question while also identifying potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts. Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and non-PPR leagues, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel. His hybridized usage in San Francisco led to one of the great seasons in recent Fantasy football history when he caught 77 passes for 1,405 yards and six touchdowns while adding 59 carries for 365 yards and eight touchdowns in 2021. However, as the 49ers added weapons, his usage dropped off, and he's also had to fight through injuries in recent years, missing eight games the last three seasons and playing through several more while hampered. Now he'll have a chance for a career reset in Washington with NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels, and he could begin the season as Washington's No. 1 receiver. Terry McLaurin is in a serious contract dispute and has been the constant subject of NFL trade rumors all offseason. Even if McLaurin's situation gets sorted, offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury should have plenty of wrinkles for Samuel, and the model predicts that he far exceeds expectations as the No. 39 wide receiver off the board on average. See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Colts tight end Tyler Warren. After an All-American career at Penn State, in which he not only had 19 touchdown receptions but also six rushing scores, Warren was the second tight end taken in the NFL Draft. He joins a Colts team in desperate need of uptick at the position as no Indy tight end had more than 14 catches or 182 yards last year. Indianapolis didn't spend a first round pick on Warren to just use him as a blocker as it has high hopes for the 2024 Mackey Award winner as the best tight end in college football. Indy used a tight end on roughly 98% of its offensive plays last season and used multiple tight ends on over a quarter of all snaps. Thus, the position clearly has a big role in the offense. The learning curve for rookie tight ends is also not as steep as in the past as players like Brock Bowers and Sam LaPorta were top-two Fantasy tight ends in their first years. SportsLine's model has Warren ahead of more established tight ends like Kyle Pitts and Evan Engram in its Fantasy football 2025 rankings. See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football busts As for players to avoid, the model lists 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. Throughout his career, when Christian McCaffrey has been healthy, he's been the most productive Fantasy football running back there is. However, we've reached the stage of his career where reliability has become a huge concern, as he's missed 10 games or more in three of the last five seasons after going three seasons without missing a game to start his career. Injuries limited McCaffrey to four games last season and his production was minimal when he was in the lineup. After piling up 2,023 scrimmage yards and scoring 21 touchdowns in his first full season with the 49ers in 2023, McCaffrey only managed 348 scrimmage yards and didn't score a single touchdown. The consensus No. 1 overall pick in last year's Fantasy football drafts was a massive liability, but he's still going at the tail end of the first round this season and is the fourth RB off the board on average. The model ranks him outside its top 10 running backs for 2025 and doesn't see him living up to his Fantasy football ADP. See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here. How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football football rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising wide receiver you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts. This wide receiver is listed as a shocking top-15 option ahead of stars like A.J. Brown and Tyreek Hill.

4 Best Fantasy Football Rookies to Draft in 2025,"The 2025 NFL rookie class is loaded with talent, and a few first-year stars are already climbing fantasy football draft boards. Whether you're looking for an instant-impact RB, a sleeper WR, or a rookie QB with upside, grabbing the right rookies can be the edge that sets your team apart.

Top Fantasy Football Rookies for 2025 Here are four NFL rookies to target in fantasy football drafts in 2025, including season-long projections for each rookie via the PrizePicks NFLSZN board. Raiders RB Ashton Jeanty The Raiders desperately needed to draft a running back after the lack of a run game last season. In 2024, they needed to find a replacement for Josh Jacobs after he left in free agency. Zamir White had a nice finish to the 2023 season and was expected to take over the starting job in 2024. Unfortunately, after rushing for 19 yards on 11 carries in the first two games, it became a committee that featured White, Alexander Mattison, Ameer Abdullah, and Sincere McCormick, but no one was good enough to lean on. Las Vegas finished last in almost every major rushing category, including rushing yards (1,357), yards per carry (3.6), first downs by rush (78), and were second to last in 20+ yard carries (4) and rushing touchdowns (10). This is why the Raiders did not hesitate to take Jeanty with the No. 6 overall pick. He has the potential to be a generational player when you look at the 2024 season he had at Boise State. He put up some historical numbers, including 2,601 rushing yards, only behind Barry Sanders (2,628) for the most in a season, along with 29 touchdowns. He will immediately be the featured running back in the offense and could be leaned on for 20+ touches per game. He has that balance of power and can continue to push forward after making initial contact, but also the elusive ability to move between the tackles and break off big runs. Jeanty is the No. 6 ranked running back in our fantasy football rankings this year, and is going in the first round of fantasy football drafts. Jaguars WR/CB Travis Hunter The intriguing situation with Hunter makes his potential even better in fantasy. The Jaguars went all in to bring Hunter to Jacksonville as they traded up to the No. 2 pick to get the dual-threat. The recent Heisman Trophy winner brings a situation that no other player has ever brought to the league: the ability to contribute on offense and defense. Throughout his college career at Jackson State and Colorado, he played full time at cornerback and wide receiver, something that hadn’t been done in modern football. Last year, he caught 1,258 passes and 15 touchdowns along with four interceptions. Now he plans to do the same at the top level. If he can find moderate success on both sides of the ball, he would be a great pick for leagues that have scoring for defensive plays (IDP). Hunter is the No. 34 ranked wide receiver in our fantasy football rankings for 2025, and is currently the 33rd WR off the board via FantasyPros ADP. Panthers WR Tetairoa McMillan Towards the end of the last season, we might have seen the Bryce Young the Panthers were expecting when they drafted him No. 1 overall. After being benched, he returned and played the best football of his professional career. From Week 8 through 18, he had a 61.8% completion rate and 15 touchdowns to just six interceptions. Young has not had that definitive top target, and that’s why Carolina got their guy. McMillan is a true wideout with speed and route-running ability to help stretch the field. Last season, he led the Big 12 with 1,319 receiving yards on 15.7 yards per reception and 5.5 yards after the reception. Young will finally have a playmaker, and he should dominate the target share. McMillan is the No. 33 ranked wide receiver in our fantasy football rankings for 2025, and is currently the 26th WR off the board via FantasyPros ADP. Titans QB Cam Ward The Titans have had bad luck drafting quarterbacks recently. In 2022, they drafted Malik Willis in the third round, and after one year, they decided he wasn’t their franchise quarterback. In 2023, they picked Will Levis in the second round, and he only had one full season as a starter before Tennessee decided to move. The Titans went all in and grabbed the Miami quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick. If he can play up to his potential, he could become their long-term solution. Ward showed off his strong arm in his lone season with the Hurricanes, thanks to 9.5 yards per attempt, and Miami’s offense led the country with 536.2 offensive yards per game. He also possesses intangibles of a high football IQ and leadership skills, and we saw him lead several comebacks for the Hurricanes last season. They’re not expected to be a contender this season, especially with a projected below-average defense, which could force Ward to make this a pass-heavy offense. Ward is not ranked in our 2025 fantasy football QB rankings, but he is the 24th QB in average draft position, via FantasyPros.

Top Rookie Running Backs To Target In 2025 Fantasy Football Drafts,"Top Rookie Running Backs To Target In 2025 Fantasy Football Drafts The 2025 NFL season is right around the corner, and it’s time to prepare for your upcoming fantasy football drafts. In this article, we’ll discuss the top rookie RBs in fantasy football 2025. Ashton Jeanty headlines the best rookie running backs fantasy rankings, but there are other notable RB draft picks 2025 to know. Plus, we’ll dive into the top dynasty rookie running backs to target for the future. Why Rookie Running Backs Matter In Fantasy The top overall rookie RBs for fantasy football 2025 are pretty well-known. Everyone would love to have Saquon Barkley, Bijan Robinson, or Jahmyr Gibbs on their rosters. Well, coincidentally, each of those guys was previously impactful and very relevant as a rookie. Let’s discuss why it’s important to know about the top rookie RBs in fantasy football 2025. Drafting rookie running backs isn’t a preferred strategy for most. It’s admittedly safer to draft the RBs that we already know have proven NFL production or a locked-in role/workload with their current teams. Yet, taking a shot on rookies can pay off in a big way. Just look at last year. There were zero running backs taken in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft and only one in the second round (Jonathan Brooks). Yet, we had a few rookie running backs who emerged as fantasy football assets. Tampa Bay Buccaneers RB Bucky Irving was a league winner for those who drafted him in the later rounds. He was going off the board as the 50th running back or so, and ended up being an RB1 by season’s end. Then there’s Tyrone Tracy, the New York Giants’ tailback who also proved to be a late-round steal. Irving and Tracy are perfect examples of rookie running backs who didn’t cost a lot to draft in fantasy football, but then returned more than enough value. Both entered NFL backfields with incumbent backs before carving out larger roles. Irving overtook Rachaad White in Tampa, while Tracy was more productive than veteran Devin Singletary in New York. This is the key with rookie RBs in fantasy football 2025. They don’t usually have big preseason expectations for fantasy or real life, besides the first or second-round NFL Draft picks. That provides some ADP value because they either enter crowded backfields and/or begin the season as the backup. Yet, as Irving and Tracy proved last year, some of these rookie running backs are worth taking a flier on in later rounds of fantasy football drafts. Injuries or underperformance from an incumbent back can open the door for the younger, fresher legs of a rookie. Some rookie RBs may not be impactful in Week 1 or Week 2, but they can emerge as a viable fantasy starter down the road. Besides Ashton Jeanty, there aren’t many rookie RBs in fantasy football 2025 who are locked into guaranteed roles or workloads right away. You have to exercise patience with these rookie backs. There’s a decent chance that one or two of the names below, in addition to Jeanty, emerge as a short-term fantasy rental or a full-time starter due to injury or late-season opportunities. Top Rookie RB Fantasy Football Rankings For 2025 Here is the top rookie RBs fantasy football 2025 list. These are just the best four RB draft picks of 2025. Honorable mentions go out to Kaleb Johnson and Cam Skattebo, who could both be valuable fantasy assets this season or as dynasty rookie running backs. Ashton Jeanty, Las Vegas Raiders Ashton Jeanty tops the rookie RBs fantasy football 2025 rankings after being one of the best RB draft prospects in recent years. The Raiders selected the Boise State standout with the 6th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. He instantly became a first-round value in fantasy football drafts and the top overall choice in dynasty rookie rankings. Jeanty should step into a bell-cow workload in the Raiders’ offense and will surely be one of the best rookie RBs in fantasy football in 2025. Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers The arrow has been pointing up for Omarion Hampton ever since the Chargers took him in the first round of this year’s NFL Draft. The UNC product will benefit from playing in Jim Harbaugh’s run-focused, ground-and-pound offense. Plus, the Chargers could be without Najee Harris to begin this season (more on that later). Hampton is being taken as the 16th running back in fantasy drafts, but he could easily outperform that ADP if he takes advantage of the favorable situation. TreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots The Patriots spent a second-round pick on TreVeyon Henderson in this year’s NFL Draft. That draft capital alone is enough to be optimistic about the former Ohio State running back. Rhamondre Stevenson still exists in the Patriots’ backfield, but he’s underperformed at times and battled injuries in recent years. Plus, Henderson has turned heads in Training Camp practices. He’ll be valuable for fantasy at some point this season. RJ Harvey, Denver Broncos RJ Harvey was yet another second-round pick in the NFL Draft. The Broncos drafted him to help fix a backfield that underwhelmed last year. Denver also signed J.K. Dobbins, which muddles the water. On the one hand, Dobbins ran for 905 yards last year and has veteran experience. Yet, he’s coming off an MCL sprain that cut his 2024 season short. Meanwhile, Harvey brings in a ton of upside to begin the season as the Broncos’ starting RB. Workload Expectations And Offensive Fit Let’s now examine the workload expectations and offensive fits for the names atop the rookie RBs fantasy football 2025 rankings. These RB draft picks 2025 may be in different scenarios, but each has a path to being valuable for fantasy. - Ashton Jeanty: Will be the Raiders’ lead back right away with a bell-cow workload. Should get 20+ touches per game with a three-down role. Offense likely revolves around him with a run-first attack. - Omarion Hampton: Likely the Chargers’ starting RB until Najee Harris returns. Can have RB1 upside as the lead back in Harbaugh’s offense. Harris and Hampton probably enter into a 1A/1B situation when the former returns. - TreVeyon Henderson: The Patriots have Rhamondre Stevenson as the incumbent starter, making things murky. Henderson may start the season as the backup or third-down RB, but he could emerge as the lead back before long. At least the Pats likely lean on the run this year to take pressure off second-year QB Drake Maye. - RJ Harvey: Even with J.K. Dobbins in town, Harvey has been taking starting reps with the Denver offense in camp. This will likely be a split backfield situation unless Harvey proves he can handle a full workload. We know Sean Payton’s offense has been favorable to running backs in the past, especially in the passing game. Well, Harvey was a productive pass-catching back in college. Could he be Payton’s next Alvin Kamara? Redraft vs. Dynasty Rookie RB Value The strategy for picking rookie RBs in fantasy football 2025 differs whether you’re in a redraft or dynasty league. Let’s take a look at the top dynasty rookie running backs as you get ready for the season. - Ashton Jeanty: He’ll be valuable right away as a rookie as the Raiders’ bell-cow. He’s being drafted as a top-5 running back in redraft leagues. As for dynasty, Jeanty is the top overall rookie pick, even in SuperFlex formats. He’s been compared to Saquon Barkley and Bijan Robinson as the next great RB who will be an elite fantasy RB for years to come. - Omarion Hampton: If Najee Harris is sidelined to begin the season, which seems likely, then Hampton can live up to his redraft value early on. His role may diminish as the season progresses, assuming Harris returns in some capacity. Hampton is also viewed as the second-best rookie RB in dynasty drafts. - TreVeyon Henderson: This is the prime example of drafting a rookie RB who may have more value later in the season than in Week 1. You may need to be patient and play the long game with Henderson. He’ll likely split work with Stevenson to start, but Henderson’s talent and production could win out. He also has more upside in dynasty leagues. - RJ Harvey: Those drafting Harvey this year are hoping for a rookie breakout. It’s an upside play that could pay off big time at his ADP. However, he’s more valuable in dynasty formats once he establishes himself as the lead back heading into Year 2 or Year 3 in Sean Payton’s offense.

Best Fantasy Football Value Pick At Each Position: League-Winning Draft Sleepers (2025),"Andersen's four fantasy football value picks and 2025 draft sleepers at each position. Read Andersen's list of fantasy football sleepers at QB, RB, WR, TE. Every season, fantasy football managers focus heavily on the first couple of rounds of the draft. After all, those are the players who will lead your team, often scoring the most points every week. However, the picks you make in the middle and late rounds will likely determine whether you win your league or end up near the bottom of the standings. Identifying value throughout the entirety of your draft can give you the upper hand as you embark on the 2025 fantasy football season. Let's look at four of the best value picks in fantasy drafts this year. These players should significantly outperform their ADP and will be on plenty of championship rosters in 2025. Be sure to check all of our fantasy football rankings for 2025:- 2025 fantasy football rankings - Running back (RB) fantasy football rankings - Wide receiver (WR) fantasy football rankings - Tight end (TE) fantasy football rankings - Quarterback (QB) fantasy football rankings - Defense (D/ST) fantasy football rankings - NFL rookie fantasy football rankings - Best ball fantasy football rankings - Superflex fantasy football rankings - Dynasty fantasy football rankings Fantasy Football Quarterback Draft Value Pick Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers Love was the fifth-highest-scoring quarterback in 2023, but we saw some regression with him last year. An injury sidelined him for two games and likely limited his ability to perform in several others. We saw Malik Willis take his place in seven of the Packers' 17 games. One year earlier, though, he rewarded fantasy managers with a 36-touchdown, 11-interception campaign. That was his first full season as the Packers' starter, giving fans plenty of optimism in the post-Aaron Rodgers era. While Love's fantasy production came back down to earth last year, there were still plenty of reasons to maintain confidence in the Utah State product. Love had the fourth-highest QBR in 2024, and he ranked ninth in fantasy points per dropback. He was also fifth among quarterbacks in air yards per attempt and fourth in explosive rating. Furthermore, Love's supporting cast only got stronger this offseason. The main newcomer in Green Bay's offense is Matthew Golden, a first-round receiver out of Texas. He'll join an offense that already features superstar running back Josh Jacobs, up-and-coming tight end Tucker Kraft, and solid complementary receivers such as Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, and Christian Watson. Love had a 66.7 percent red zone completion rate last season, which ranked fifth in the NFL. With a reinforced offense at his disposal, Love should be able to lead more drives into scoring range, and his red zone completion rate suggests he'll have no trouble completing touchdown passes near the goal line. We won't guarantee Love has the best fantasy season of his career; that would require finishing among the top five quarterbacks. However, barring injury, he should finish significantly higher than his ADP. He's currently being drafted 135th overall, making him the 18th quarterback off the board. If Love finishes among the top 12 quarterbacks (which he should), you're getting a steal in the 12th round. First look at the Jordan Love + Matthew Golden connection 👀 (via @JoriEpstein)pic.twitter.com/0UpmKMLL5a — Yahoo Fantasy Sports (@YahooFantasy) May 28, 2025 Fantasy Football Running Back Draft Value Pick Aaron Jones, Minnesota Vikings The NFC North witnessed a major shakeup in March 2024 as the Packers signed Jacobs and released Aaron Jones. The longtime Packer found his way to enemy territory, signing with the Vikings immediately. The UTEP product remained a reliable every-down threat in his new role as Minnesota's No. 1 running back. Jones ultimately totaled 1,138 rushing yards, 408 receiving yards, and seven touchdowns over 17 games last year. He was on the field more than ever, setting a career-high in snaps and touches. The increased workload didn't appear to impact his productivity or availability. For the second time in three years, he was healthy and active for all 17 games. He ranked seventh among NFL running backs in routes run, third in game script, and first in under-center carry rate. It's worth noting that the Vikings did bring in Jordan Mason this offseason, and Kevin O'Connell intends to get him on the field. However, this may be a blessing in disguise for Jones. Mason is primarily expected to handle short-yardage opportunities, which means Jones will lose a few yards here and there, plus maybe a touchdown or two. But it's not like Jones was a major touchdown merchant. He scored just seven times last year, instead accruing most of his points on rushing yards and receptions. Jones should still eclipse a half-dozen touchdowns, and he'll contend for 1,500 scrimmage yards once again. Plus, Mason earning short-yardage snaps should keep Jones healthy, which is vital at 30 years old. It's fair to be cautious with Jones in 2025, but that means avoiding him at a top-12 running back price tag. His current ADP of 71 has an implied ranking of RB25, which is simply perplexing for one of this decade's most dependable, productive running backs. Don't let his age deter you; Jones will prove to be a steal this season. #Vikings HC Kevin O’Connell on his backfield: “Aaron Jones is at his best when we can keep him fresh, we can keep him truly as that 1a, because we’ve got the 1b with him, and that was Jordan Mason.” pic.twitter.com/5nGWoeX3vb — The Coachspeak Index (@CoachspeakIndex) April 1, 2025 Fantasy Football Wide Receiver Draft Value Pick Darnell Mooney, Atlanta Falcons Mooney enjoyed a resurgence during his first season with the Falcons. The former longtime Chicago Bear became the No. 2 receiver in offensive guru Zac Robinson's system, catching 64 passes for 992 yards and five touchdowns. If not for missing the final game with a shoulder issue, he surely would have eclipsed 1,000 yards for the second time in his career. Despite missing that final contest, Mooney maintained a phenomenal 92.4 percent snap share, which ranked seventh among NFL wide receivers. He finished the year as the overall WR31 in PPR leagues. As much as Mooney impressed last year, he's expected to take another step forward — and have an even larger role — during the 2025 season. Wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard recently indicated the Falcons plan to get him more targets ""and see where that goes."" Mooney himself said that he performed well on deep routes last year, and Michael Penix Jr. acknowledged how difficult he is to cover one-on-one. The quarterback's observations fall in line with the advanced metrics; Mooney had an explosive rating of 122.8 last year, ranking sixth among wide receivers. A full offseason of work with Penix, who has taken over as the Falcons' starting quarterback, should bode quite well for Mooney. In general, his familiarity with the Falcons' offense — he can approach this offseason as a returner, rather than a newcomer learning a foreign offense — should go a long way. Yet, we're not seeing any optimism baked into his ADP. He's currently being drafted 113th, making him the 51st receiver off the board. His price tag has somehow gotten cheaper since Hilliard went public with the Falcons' plans to get Mooney more involved. Mooney is being drafted like a fringe bench receiver when all signs point to him being a weekly flex with legitimate WR2 upside. Savvy managers will jump on this opportunity to get an impact receiver in the 10th round. Michael Penix Jr. to Darnell Mooney is going to be a fun pair to watch this season. pic.twitter.com/AuwqWidJM2 — Nick Penticoff (@NickPenticoff) June 12, 2025 Fantasy Football Tight End Draft Value Pick Zach Ertz, Washington Commanders The Commanders brought in Ertz last year to provide a veteran presence in a young offense led by Jayden Daniels. The signing paid major dividends as Ertz firmly grasped onto the No. 1 tight end role, catching 66 passes for 654 yards and seven touchdowns. He finished as the overall TE7 in PPR leagues. Among NFL tight ends last year, Ertz ranked third in slot snaps, sixth in air yards, and fourth in red zone targets. He had six games with at least five catches, as well as one outing with 11 targets. He scored six times over the final seven contests, averaging 13.5 points during that span. Throughout the season, not only did Ertz produce as a receiver, but he was also an effective blocker, creating opportunities for Daniels on the ground. Tight ends who block well typically earn more snaps, and that's what we saw with Ertz, who held off rookie Ben Sinnott despite being in his mid-30s. One important component of Ertz's productivity was the type of routes he ran. According to Tyler Buecher of FantasyGuru.com, Ertz ran horizontal-breaking routes at a 47.7 percent rate, which ranked first among tight ends in the league. This should be sustainable, and it could help Ertz rank as a top-eight fantasy tight end once again in 2025. However, Ertz has an ADP of 221, which ranks him as the overall TE26. That price tag makes him undrafted in most 12-team leagues with 16 rounds, and it would make him one of the last few picks in 14-team formats. Maybe the addition of Deebo Samuel Sr. or Ertz's age justifies knocking him down a slot or two; perhaps last year's TE7 finisher regresses to a fringe top-12 option this year. But there is no way to justify Ertz being the 26th tight end off the board. Don't waste a 10th-round pick on a fringe tight end starter when you can get Ertz in the 16th — or on waivers. Year 13 in the NFL for Commanders TE Zach Ertz. The dude is hungrier than ever and had a lot of great things to say about Jayden Daniels. On Jayden, Ertz said, ""A lot of guys love playing for him."" pic.twitter.com/NQODhDA5M0 — Scott Abraham (@Scott7news) June 4, 2025 Download Our Free News & Alerts Mobile App Like what you see?

"Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year","Fantasy football rankings 2025: Sleepers, busts, breakouts from simulation that nailed C.J. Stroud's off year SportsLine simulated the new NFL season 10,000 times and identified 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts for upcoming drafts Raiders tight end Brock Bowers is coming off the most prolific season for a rookie tight end in NFL history after catching 112 passes for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns. He was first-team All-Pro despite playing with three different starting quarterbacks, and there's optimism that the offseason additions of Geno Smith and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty will only aid his production. Where exactly should you be targeting Bowers in your upcoming 2025 Fantasy football drafts? Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren were top 14 picks at tight end in the 2025 NFL Draft as Bowers was last year, but is either ready to slot into your Fantasy football lineups this season? A reliable set of 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer those questions and also identify potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts before you go on the clock. A reliable set of live-updated 2025 Fantasy football rankings can help you answer that question while also identifying potential 2025 Fantasy football sleepers, breakouts and busts. Before setting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud might take a step back in his second season. He finished as QB18 and anybody who avoided drafting him early dodged a major headache in their Fantasy football lineups. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and calling Rachaad White's breakout in 2023. Additionally, it has called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest 2025 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and non-PPR leagues, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2025 Fantasy football sleepers One of the 2025 Fantasy football sleepers the model is predicting: Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel. His hybridized usage in San Francisco led to one of the great seasons in recent Fantasy football history when he caught 77 passes for 1,405 yards and six touchdowns while adding 59 carries for 365 yards and eight touchdowns in 2021. However, as the 49ers added weapons, his usage dropped off, and he's also had to fight through injuries in recent years, missing eight games the last three seasons and playing through several more while hampered. Now he'll have a chance for a career reset in Washington with NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels, and he could begin the season as Washington's No. 1 receiver. Terry McLaurin is in a serious contract dispute and has been the constant subject of NFL trade rumors all offseason. Even if McLaurin's situation gets sorted, offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury should have plenty of wrinkles for Samuel, and the model predicts that he far exceeds expectations as the No. 39 wide receiver off the board on average. See more Fantasy football sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football breakouts One of the 2025 Fantasy football breakouts the model is predicting: Colts tight end Tyler Warren. After an All-American career at Penn State, in which he not only had 19 touchdown receptions but also six rushing scores, Warren was the second tight end taken in the NFL Draft. He joins a Colts team in desperate need of uptick at the position as no Indy tight end had more than 14 catches or 182 yards last year. Indianapolis didn't spend a first round pick on Warren to just use him as a blocker as it has high hopes for the 2024 Mackey Award winner as the best tight end in college football. Indy used a tight end on roughly 98% of its offensive plays last season and used multiple tight ends on over a quarter of all snaps. Thus, the position clearly has a big role in the offense. The learning curve for rookie tight ends is also not as steep as in the past as players like Brock Bowers and Sam LaPorta were top-two Fantasy tight ends in their first years. SportsLine's model has Warren ahead of more established tight ends like Kyle Pitts and Evan Engram in its Fantasy football 2025 rankings. See more Fantasy football breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy football busts As for players to avoid, the model lists 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey as one of its 2025 Fantasy football busts. Throughout his career, when Christian McCaffrey has been healthy, he's been the most productive Fantasy football running back there is. However, we've reached the stage of his career where reliability has become a huge concern, as he's missed 10 games or more in three of the last five seasons after going three seasons without missing a game to start his career. Injuries limited McCaffrey to four games last season and his production was minimal when he was in the lineup. After piling up 2,023 scrimmage yards and scoring 21 touchdowns in his first full season with the 49ers in 2023, McCaffrey only managed 348 scrimmage yards and didn't score a single touchdown. The consensus No. 1 overall pick in last year's Fantasy football drafts was a massive liability, but he's still going at the tail end of the first round this season and is the fourth RB off the board on average. The model ranks him outside its top 10 running backs for 2025 and doesn't see him living up to his Fantasy football ADP. See more Fantasy football busts 2025 here. How to find proven 2025 Fantasy football football rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising wide receiver you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy football drafts. This wide receiver is listed as a shocking top-15 option ahead of stars like A.J. Brown and Tyreek Hill. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy football rankings for every player, at SportsLine. So which 2025 Fantasy Football sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which WR shocks the NFL with a top-15 performance?

Stroud's disappointing sophomore season in 2024, and find out.",2025-08-07,https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-busts-breakouts-by-nfl-model-that-projected-c-j-strouds-down-year/
"Fantasy football 2024 rankings, draft prep: Optimal QB, RB, WR, TE picks, cheat sheets, ADP, NFL tiers","Fantasy football 2024 rankings, draft prep: Optimal QB, RB, WR, TE picks, cheat sheets, ADP, NFL tiers SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed optimal 2024 Fantasy football rankings The Week 1 NFL schedule opens with a rematch of last year's AFC Championship Game between the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday in the 2024 NFL Kickoff Game. Both teams feature multiple players near the top of the 2024 fantasy football rankings. Lamar Jackson and Patrick Mahomes both sit near the top of the 2024 fantasy football QB rankings and have teammates who are among the top 2024 fantasy football sleepers, breakout, and bust candidates in the NFL. For Baltimore, running back Derrick Henry, wide receiver Zay Flowers, and tight end Mark Andrews all have the ability to be high-end fantasy producers, but Henry and Andrews come with injury risk. Wide receivers Rashee Rice, Marquise Brown, and Xaiver Worthy are all potential fantasy 2024 Fantasy football breakout players for Kansas City. With a reliable set of 2024 Fantasy football rankings, you can make informed decisions at every position and build a 2024 Fantasy football strategy that is set up for season-long success. If you're looking for 2024 Fantasy football advice, be sure to check out the 2024 Fantasy football cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Last year, the model accurately predicted that Dolphins wide receiver Jaylen Waddle would fail to live up to his Fantasy football ADP. Waddle's 2023 Fantasy football ADP was 34.86 overall and he was the 11th receiver off the board on average. He'd go on to notch a 1,000-yard season but only had 72 receptions with four touchdowns and he'd finish as the No. 34 Fantasy football wide receiver in CBS Sports PPR leagues. The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020 and nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title. The model is powered by the same people who generated projections for all three major Fantasy sites, and it beat human experts last season when there was a big difference in ranking.

Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NFL season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy football cheat sheets 2024 and draft advice, along with its top Fantasy QB, WR, RB and TE picks. Head to SportsLine now to see them. Top 2024 Fantasy football QB rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top three 2024 Fantasy football QB picks: 1. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills: Allen threw 18 interceptions last season but everything else he does as a Fantasy football quarterback makes the turnovers palatable. He's thrown for at least 4,283 yards and 29 touchdowns in each of the last four seasons while averaging over 600 yards and nine touchdowns per season on the ground, finishing as QB1 or QB2 in each of those years. 2. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles: Over the last three seasons, Hurts has rushed for 2,149 yards and 38 touchdowns, and that goal-line productivity alone would make him worth Fantasy consideration. However, he's also improved his passing yardage and passing touchdown numbers in every season of his career. He was already QB2 last season and if that trend continues, he could be the top Fantasy football quarterback in 2024. 3. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens: The knock on Jackson was always that he wasn't capable of beating teams from the pocket, but he certainly put that theory to the test last season in a new offense with Todd Monken calling plays. He set new career-highs in completion percentage (67.2) and passing yards (3,678) while producing a 24-7 touchdown-to-interception ratio. He also still ran for 821 yards and five touchdowns on his way to winning NFL MVP honors for a second time. See more top QBs here. Top 2024 Fantasy football RB rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top three 2024 Fantasy football RB picks: 1. Christian McCaffrey, San Francisco 49ers: Injuries have been the only thing that have slowed McCaffrey down during his career, and his healthy ceiling was on full display last year. He finished as the Fantasy RB1 in 81% of his games and inside the top 24 in every game he played. McCaffrey averaged more than 21 touches and 126.5 total yards per game, so he remains the obvious No. 1 pick. 2. Breece Hall, New York Jets: The 23-year-old returned from a knee injury last season and finished as the RB6 in Fantasy points per game. He averaged 20.2 touches and 102.5 total yards per game from Weeks 5-18, which are the key numbers to focus on heading into this season. Hall offers receiving upside to go along with his elite rushing ability, making him the model's No. 2 running back this year. 3. Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles: Barkley's move from New York to Philadelphia was one of the biggest moves of the offseason, as the veteran finally joins a competent offense. He is still one of the league's most explosive running backs, and he is going to have plenty of scoring opportunities with the Eagles. His goal-line upside alone makes him worth rostering in 2024 Fantasy football lineups. See more top RBs here. Top 2024 Fantasy football WR rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top three 2024 Fantasy football WR picks: 1. CeeDee Lamb, Dallas Cowboys: Lamb exploded in 2023, catching 135 passes for 1,749 yards and 12 touchdowns. Down the stretch, Lamb was at his best, and has an obvious rapport with quarterback Dak Prescott. Lamb landed the new contract he was looking for and is primed for another big season in 2024. 2. Tyreek Hill, Miami Dolphins: Hill is a threat to score every time he touches the ball, and head coach Mike McDaniel has made getting the ball in his hands a top priority. Hill led the NFL in receiving yards (1,799) and touchdown receptions (13) in 2023. The 30-year-old is looking for his third-straight season with 1,700 or more receiving yards. 3. Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions: St. Brown continues to prove people wrong, and enters 2024 looking for his third-straight year with 1,100 or more receiving yards. In 2023, St. Brown caught 119 passes for 1,515 yards and 10 touchdowns. With the talent around him, the former USC standout will likely see plenty of single coverage in 2024. See more top WRs here. Top 2024 Fantasy football TE rankings Here's a look at SportsLine's top three 2024 Fantasy football TE picks: 1. Travis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs: For eight straight years, Kelce has ranked amongst the top three tight ends in Fantasy points, finishing first five times. His numbers dipped a bit last year, but he was slowed at the start of the season due to an injury, and then the lack of WR threats on Kansas City funneled coverage in his direction. Neither of those factors are present in 2024 so he should reclaim his throne as the king of the position. 2. Sam LaPorta, Detroit Lions: LaPorta broke records left and right in his first year. He set the NFL mark for most receptions by a rookie tight end (86) and also tied the league record for most TDs by a rookie tight end (10) in the Super Bowl era. With Detroit losing its No. 2 wide receiver in Josh Reynolds, LaPorta could be an even bigger focal point of the offense as a sophomore. 3. Mark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens: The veteran played just nine full games a year ago, but if you project his stats from those nine over a 17-game season, then you'd get a stat line of 81-984-11. That would have led the tight end position in Fantasy points in 2023, and there's no reason to believe he can't supply that type of production this season. See more top TEs here.

"Fantasy football: Sleepers, busts and breakouts for 2025","As fantasy football draft season inches closer and closer, it's time for our annual predictions of sleepers, busts and breakout players. Interpretations of the terms can vary for each, but here are the definitions for our purposes: • Sleeper: A player who is being overlooked and will outperform his average draft position (ADP) in 2025. • Bust: A highly regarded player who will underperform in 2025, relative to his ADP/ranking. • Breakout: A player who will put up career-best numbers in 2025 and make a huge impact. Stephania Bell, Matt Bowen, Mike Clay, Tristan H. Cockcroft, Daniel Dopp, Tyler Fulghum, Eric Karabell, Liz Loza, Eric Moody and Field Yates each contributed a sleeper and a bust for the major offensive positions, as well as one breakout candidate. You can find their picks below, as well as their analysis and insights on a selection of players they felt most passionate about in each category. Editor's note: This story will be updated throughout the preseason. Jump to: Sleepers | Busts | Breakouts Sign up for ESPN Fantasy Football. Play the No. 1 Fantasy game for free! Sleepers Cockcroft: While we've seen nothing yet from J.J. McCarthy at this level, as he missed his entire rookie season recovering from multiple knee surgeries, he is in one of his position's best situations in which to succeed. Coach Kevin O'Connell's offensive scheme heavily favors quarterbacks, with the position averaging 17.8 fantasy points per game (that's 302.4 in a 17-game season) in his three years in the role. And McCarthy has one of the most talented groups of receivers, led by Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson, with whom to work. Bowen: At 6-foot-1, 224 pounds with straight-line acceleration and vision, Kaleb Johnson is an easy fit for the outside zone scheme in Pittsburgh. He had 21 rushes of 20 or more yards last season at Iowa -- the second most in the country behind Ashton Jeanty -- and he can post receiving numbers on swings, screens and unders. Johnson will share the backfield with Jaylen Warren, but the early-down volume in a run-heavy offense can push him into the RB2 ranks. Karabell: Some might fade Travis Hunter in fantasy because of concern with potential snaps as a two-way player, but the Jaguars seem more likely to use him on offense rather than at cornerback. Hunter offers immediate WR2 upside, with a competent QB in Trevor Lawrence and a legitimate WR1 in Brian Thomas Jr. drawing more attention, and at an odd fraction of the cost according to early ADP figures (Thomas 19.0, Hunter 68.6). Clay: The 10th pick in April's draft, Colston Loveland has a ton of competition for targets in Chicago, but he very well could demand a generous share right out of the gate, should he prove the real deal. Working with new coach Ben Johnson and second-year QB Caleb Williams, Loveland certainly could work his way to lineup lock status during his rookie campaign. Rookie tight ends have generally struggled to make Year 1 impacts, but times might be changing, considering a first-year player paced the position each of the past two seasons (Sam LaPorta, Brock Bowers). Busts Dopp: Baker Mayfield's ADP is between QB6 and QB7, which means you're likely drafting him at his ceiling (unless you think he'll best Josh Allen, Jayden Daniels, Jalen Hurts, Joe Burrow or Lamar Jackson this season). With offensive coordinator Liam Coen now the head coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars and the questions surrounding Chris Godwin (injury) and Mike Evans (age), I'd rather draft someone with a little more headroom in their value. Fulghum: James Cook screams regression candidate in 2025, especially with his ADP hovering around RB10 to RB12. Despite scoring a combined nine total TDs in his first two seasons, Cook exploded in 2024 with 18 total TDs -- including a league-leading 16 on the ground. With Josh Allen continuing to dominate goal-line work and second-year RB Ray Davis earning more opportunities, Cook's touchdown rate relative to his volume of touches is simply not sustainable. Yates: DJ Moore is an excellent player who has shown himself to be a fantasy star. I'm bullish on QB Caleb Williams under Ben Johnson's tutelage and think this offense could make a massive leap, but Moore's outlook has me a little uneasy. The Bears selected tight end Colston Loveland and receiver Luther Burden III with their first two picks in the draft, adding two more pass-catchers to an offense that is already banking on a breakout year from second-year wideout Rome Odunze. While it's easy to imagine Moore taking on an Amon-Ra St. Brown role under Johnson, it's also possible the offense just has more balance overall, à la Detroit in 2024 (when St. Brown was a slightly steadier weekly option). Moore and Williams didn't build as seamless a chemistry as I expected last season. Moody: Kansas City's Rashee Rice is being drafted as a top-20 WR despite major red flags. He's coming off LCL surgery and faces a potential suspension (though one isn't expected in 2025) and serious target competition from Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and Travis Kelce. Rice flashed elite usage early last season (36% target share in three full games), but that production came during a stretch when Brown was injured and Worthy was still getting acclimated to the league (RB Isiah Pacheco also was sidelined). With just four career WR1 weekly finishes and no proven production in a full-strength offense, Rice's ADP carries considerable risk. Breakouts Ashton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas Raiders: I'll take the layup. The No. 6 pick in April's draft, Jeanty is easily the top fantasy prospect in this rookie class following a dominant tenure at Boise State. With 33-year-old Raheem Mostert his top threat for touches, Jeanty is positioned for a feature-back role right out of the gate in Las Vegas. An elite playmaker with a three-down skill set, Jeanty has the upside to be an elite fantasy football running back. -- Clay Drake Maye, QB, Patriots: Maye produced relevant fantasy numbers as a rookie, despite not starting a game until October, burdened by the lack of any semblance of game-breakers surrounding him and dealing with an incompetent coaching staff. That changes this season, with proven WR Stefon Diggs and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels among the noteworthy additions. Maye adds value with his legs and, with a little help, could easily perform at a QB1 level. -- Karabell Caleb Williams, QB, Bears: The Bears upgraded Williams' head coach/playcaller, offensive line and pass-catchers in the draft and free agency. With Ben Johnson expected to bring a QB-friendly system that revived Jared Goff's career in Detroit, Williams is poised to become the first QB in Bears franchise history to exceed 4,000 passing yards and/or 30 TDs in a season. Don't forget about his untapped rushing upside, as well (400-plus rushing yards in each of his past two college seasons). -- Fulghum Rashee Rice, WR, Chiefs: One could argue Rice has already ""broken out,"" but he hasn't shown the consistency we need to see in fantasy. There is still some legit concern about a potential suspension to start this season, which means Rice will drop from being drafted as a top-15 WR to top 20-25 instead. When healthy over the past two years, Rice clearly took over the security blanket role that Travis Kelce had dominated for years in this Chiefs offense, and that role should only grow stronger with another year under his belt. Rice is a top-15 WR when he's on the field, and should be easy to replace early in the season if he does gets suspended, given the depth at the wide receiver position. He should be drafted as a low-end WR2 or high-end WR3 that can easily give you WR1 value on a per-game basis. -- Dopp Rome Odunze, WR, Bears: A top-15 wide receiver in end zone targets and average depth of target as a rookie, Odunze should emerge as a more consistent member of an improving Bears offense in 2025. The arrival of Ben Johnson, as well as the continued growth of quarterback Caleb Williams, should only help Odunze's breakout prospects. He is a sizable target with explosive ability and among the highest statistical ceilings at the position. -- Cockcroft Ladd McConkey, WR, Chargers: McConkey finished top 20 in receptions and receiving yards as a rookie, so it can reasonably be argued that he broke out in 2024. But it's his final seven games last season that have me most enthused. After posting just one game over 80 receiving yards in his first nine outings, McConkey reached at least 80 in six of his final seven games, catching at least five passes in all of them and hauling in three 40-plus-yard grabs (compared to just one in his first nine games). He's the clear top receiving option with an excellent quarterback, and his role and usage should soar even further this season, giving him top-10 receiver upside. -- Yates Jameson Williams, WR, Lions: Williams had 16 receptions of 20 or more yards last season, and he averaged 14.4 fantasy points per game, buoyed by four games of 22-plus points. Despite a lack of consistent end zone targets (only four last season), Williams' electric play speed and route deployment can produce breakout weeks in one of the league's top scoring offenses. And with a bump in volume, Williams could jump into the WR2 mix. -- Bowen Keon Coleman, WR, Bills: Coleman has a clear path to a starting role in a high-powered Josh Allen offense and last season flashed serious big-play ability as a rookie. Despite missing four games, Coleman hauled in 12 passes of 20-plus yards and averaged 19.2 yards per reception, the third-highest mark in the league among players with at least 40 targets. With improved health and no true backup at X receiver, Coleman is positioned to make a second-year leap. -- Moody Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Arizona Cardinals: Many expected Harrison to emerge on the pro scene with a bang, but his underwhelming rookie season landed more like a thud. After scoring four touchdowns in his first four games, Harrison scored only four more the rest of the season, and his catch percentage (53.4%) was lowest among all rookie wide receivers. But his talent and pedigree are unchanged and lessons learned from Year 1 could go a long way toward making 2025 his breakout season. Plus, outside of Trey McBride, he faces little competition for targets. -- Bell Justin Fields, QB, New York Jets: Full disclosure, I'm a long enduring Fields apologist. Had he been afforded the same opportunities as Caleb Williams, perhaps his potential ""breakout"" could have happened well before his fifth year in the league. Regardless, Fields is finally paired with an offensive coordinator who appears to understand his specific skill set. Tanner Engstrand, who called plays in the XFL and comes from the Dan Campbell coaching tree, has promised to stay aggressive and focus on the run. That bodes well for Fields' rushing opportunities, which is an obvious Konami code for fantasy. To that point, Fields was a top-two producer at the position in carries as well as rushing yards per game as the Bears' starter in 2022 and 2023. That ground production helped him finish each campaign as a top-10 fantasy QB. There's no reason to believe he can't duplicate those numbers in New York, especially when noting his reunion with fellow Buckeye Garrett Wilson. Durability remains a concern, but given his depressed ADP (125), Fields projects as one of the best values at QB heading into the fall. -- Loza",2025-08-04,https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/FFSleepBustBreak25-45429092/fantasy-football-2025-rankings-nfl-sleepers-breakouts-busts
Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Half-PPR,"More than 40 hours of research went into the ranking process. It started by coming up with custom stat projections for around 250 NFL players. Those projections are based on the offenses NFL teams run, the volume of plays within those offenses, target/rushing shares, etc. Volume is a huge component of fantasy success—I’d argue it is nearly as important as a player’s talent—so a player’s potential workload is a major factor to consider. From there, I adjusted the order you’ll see below based on upside, injury risk, the likelihood of reaching the projected point total, etc. It’s important to keep in mind that the rankings are not simply in descending order of projected fantasy points. All of my rankings reflect the order in which I would take players if I were drafting today in a 12-team, half-PPR league with no bonuses and standard lineup construction. These rankings will be updated throughout the offseason, so be sure to check in with The Draft Network’s fantasy football page often to gain an edge on your league-mates. If you have any specific questions or want to know more about what I think of certain players, hit me up on Twitter (@JaimeEisner) or Instagram (@JaimeEisner_). I’d be happy to chat with you!

Fantasy football rankings 2025: Top 30 players for 2025 NFL season,"Fantasy football rankings 2025: Top 30 players for 2025 NFL season The 2024 fantasy football season is over. Maybe you won your league, and are drawing the ire of your league mates. Unfortunately, that's probably not the case for most of you. The embarrassment that comes with failing to win your fantasy championship is something most wouldn't wish on their worst enemies. With that in mind, you should be taking every step possible to ensure you are next year's champion. It's never too early to start thinking about next fantasy season, and the earlier you start, the better your chances of winning your league. Here are the top 30 fantasy football players for 2025. Fantasy football: 2025 player rankings 1. WR Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals This one is a no-brainer. The Bengals' star receiver has finished with over 15 points per game every year he's been in the league, and with teammate Tee Higgins hitting free agency this offseason, there's a chance that Chase winds up with an even bigger workload moving forward. 2. RB Saquon Barkley, Eagles Despite constantly getting vultured at the 1-yard line, Barkley was still the best running back in fantasy due to his bell-cow workload and touchdown upside. Given Jalen Hurts' late-season injury, perhaps the Eagles will reel back on the tush pushes in 2025 in order to keep their signal-caller healthy. Maybe Barkley will finally start getting touchdowns from the half-inch line moving forward. 3. WR Justin Jefferson, Vikings Jefferson may not have the same 50-point upside that Chase has, but Jefferson is arguably the most consistent wide receiver in fantasy. Not only is he quarterback-proof, but he only had two weeks with under 10 fantasy points this year. 4. RB Bijan Robinson, Falcons Coming down the stretch in 2024, there wasn't a bigger savior than Robinson. Assuming the Falcons get improved quarterback play from Michael Penix Jr. in his sophomore season, the Falcons' offense could be more potent in 2025 than it was in 2024, which means Robinson could have an even more spectacular season. 5. WR Puka Nacua, Rams It's easy to forget just how good Nacua was this year, between his injuries and Cooper Kupp's few huge games. But Nacua had only one full game all year with less than eight targets. Nacua is becoming what Kupp was just as Kupp is becoming what he is now. Does that make sense? It doesn't matter. All you need to know is that Nacua is the top dog in Los Angeles by a wide margin, and he's got remarkable volume for someone most people might overlook due to his injuries. 6. WR CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys Dak Prescott will return next season, and when he does, Lamb will return to his 2023 form. Of course, Lamb's 2024 form with Cooper Rush wasn't too bad, either, but there's no denying that when the Cowboys are at full strength, Lamb has WR1 potential. 7. RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions While there is concern about both David Montgomery's presence as well as the potential departure of Lions OC Ben Johnson, Gibbs is a dual-threat, consistent performer, and definitely worth taking in the first round. 8. WR Nico Collins, Texans With Tank Dell coming off a major injury and Stefon Diggs likely gone, Collins — who was the WR1 prior to his injury earlier this year — could have a massive workload in 2025. However, with quarterback C.J. Stroud regressing considerably this year, Collins' value in 2025 is harder to judge; he's one of the riskier first-round options. 9. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions The emergence of Jameson Williams in Detroit has St. Brown dropping a few points in 2025. However, he's still a very consistent producer who just set a new career-high in touchdown receptions with 12. 10. WR Brian Thomas Jr., Jaguars He's young. He's a deep threat. And he just finished 2024 as the WR4. While he did benefit significantly from injuries to fellow pass-catchers, he was also working with Mac Jones as his quarterback for half the year. Consider Thomas a great starter with WR1 upside. 11. WR Malik Nabers, Giants Nabers reached 1,000 yards in 2024 with Daniel Jones, Tommy DeVito and Drew Lock at QB. Imagine what he could do with Shedeur Sanders or Cam Ward? 12. RB De'Von Achane, Dolphins Achane's viability as a RB1 is based on Tua Tagovailoa's health. That's a pretty hefty risk, but Achane is football's most efficient running back when the Dolphins are at full strength. He's a reception machine, a touchdown monster, and Raheem Mostert is only getting older. 13. WR A.J. Brown, Eagles Brown lost some production in 2024 due to the Eagles' incredible run game (thanks, Saquon). However, he still earned more than a third of the team's targets when he played and nearly half of the team's total air yards. He might not be as valuable in PPR leagues, but he should rebound substantially in 2025. 14. RB Chase Brown, Bengals Bell cow running backs in elite offenses are always incredible options. Brown is young, can catch passes and has a surprisingly high explosiveness rating for someone who started 2024 behind Zack Moss. 15. RB Christian McCaffrey, 49ers Do you feel lucky? McCaffrey will enter the 2025 season at 29 years old with a substantial injury history. However, there are few running backs in the NFL who match his upside. Being able to grab the potential No. 1 overall player in fantasy in the mid-second round is a move that could make or break a season. 16. RB Josh Jacobs, Packers Jacobs may not be much of a pass-catcher, but he's still young and in one of the most run-heavy offenses in the NFL. We also know the Packers don't like to draft receivers, meaning quarterback Jordan Love's targets likely won't improve much between now and the start of next season. 17. RB Bucky Irving, Buccaneers Irving is a master at breaking tackles. So long as Liam Coen remains in Tampa, Irving's role in the Bucs' offense should continue to rise. 18. TE Brock Bowers, Raiders Everything points to a terrific 2025 season for Bowers. The Raiders are in prime position to draft a quarterback, meaning Bowers' targets should improve next season. Davante Adams isn't returning to Vegas anytime soon, and the Raiders still don't have a great running back to carry their ground game. That said, the volatility of the tight end position cannot be understated. Sam LaPorta was a second-round pick in many people's eyes a season ago. But his sophomore season was underwhelming. Bowers was a more promising prospect, but after getting burned on tight ends in 2024, taking one so early in 2025 could be a dangerous move. 19. TE Trey McBride, Cardinals McBride does not possess the same upside as Bowers, but he has a much higher floor, having proven himself now two seasons in a row. He ended this season as the TE3 despite only catching one touchdown all season, giving him room to grow between 2024 and 2025. 20. RB Derrick Henry, Ravens Father Time is undefeated, but Henry is giving him a good fight. That said, in the world of fantasy, it's always better to give up on a player a year early than to give up on them a year too late. Eventually, Henry will succumb to regression, so although he finished 2024 as a high-end RB1, he's a bit risky to draft in the first or early-second round. 21. RB Kyren Williams, Rams Williams was a workhorse in 2024. However, the emergence of rookie Blake Corum this year was noticeable. Corum started to earn more carries down the stretch this season, and Williams could see his workload decrease in 2025. Couple that with Williams' lackluster production, and he's no longer a surefire RB1. 22. RB Alvin Kamara, Saints Kamara is a player that many people will overlook. Why? He's 30 and on one of the worst teams in the NFL. However, unlike Derrick Henry, when Kamara starts regressing as a rusher, he'll still hold value as an elite backfield pass-catcher. Kamara's ceiling isn't necessarily the highest, but he has a pretty safe floor even if he falls off as a rusher. 23. RB Joe Mixon, Texans Mixon was the RB5 in the fantasy regular season, but then disappointed in the playoffs. If C.J. Stroud cannot bounce back in 2025, Mixon may have trouble returning value. However, the Texans have the potential to be one of the most potent offenses in the NFL, and Mixon is the clear lead back, giving him a ton of upside. 24. RB James Cook, Bills Touchdowns are the key for Cook. In 2023, we saw him at his absolute worst as a touchdown scorer. In 2024, we saw him at his absolute best, leading the league in that category. In 2025, it's likely he'll fall somewhere in the middle, making him a rather unpredictable option. Still, as the lead back in a terrifying Buffalo offense, he's certainly worth a late second-round pick. 25. QB Josh Allen, Bills Here's a quarterback that does not miss time due to injuries and is receiver-proof. Stefon Diggs' absence had absolutely no effect on Allen's performance, and he's still as mobile as ever, making 10-plus rushing touchdowns a real possibility. 26. QB Lamar Jackson, Ravens In 2023, Jackson won the MVP award, yet somehow he was even better in 2024. He may not have the same 50-point upside as Allen, but he's a much more consistent performer who could easily average over 25 points per game. 27. RB Ashton Jeanty, TBD It's not uncommon to see a rookie running back finish the season as an RB1. However, Jeanty's tread in college and lack of playtime against elite competition, along with the NFL trend of limiting rookie running backs' carries, makes him a riskier option than other top RB prospects of the past. Also, we still don't know where he'll end up. Depending on his situation, his stock could rise or drop significantly. 28. RB Jonathan Taylor, Colts Taylor, who will soon turn 26 years old, was a pretty boom-or-bust option for most of the 2024 season. Unless Anthony Richardson improves drastically in 2025, Taylor's volatility could continue, which lowers his value somewhat. 29. RB Breece Hall, Jets The 2024 season might be Aaron Rodgers' last, and that could be a good thing for Hall, who was a better performer with Zach Wilson under center. That also raises Hall's floor significantly, since he has room to grow if the quarterback play in New York can improve. 30. WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks JSN quietly had an incredible 2024 season, finishing the year ranking top-eight in the NFL in targets, receptions and receiving yards. That alone makes him an incredible starting option that you could secure in the third round of drafts. Gambling involves risk. Please only gamble with funds that you can comfortably afford to lose.
